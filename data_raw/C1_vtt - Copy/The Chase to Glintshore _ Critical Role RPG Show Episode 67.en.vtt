00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.588
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around and play
Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons.

00:00:06.588 --> 00:00:07.975
LIAM: I take offense at that!

00:00:07.975 --> 00:00:11.043
MATT: Yep. Welcome to the chaos.

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:12.425
TALIESIN: We're cool.

00:00:12.425 --> 00:00:15.678
MATT: Well, you guys are cool. I'm still working on
it.

00:00:15.678 --> 00:00:18.661
LAURA: You're in that picture too, Matthew.

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.502
MATT: I am, but of all the people in that picture,
I think I needed the most work.

00:00:21.502 --> 00:00:24.450
TRAVIS: Oh, come on! Get out of here!

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.083
LIAM: Loser contest, loser contest! I am the
biggest loser!

00:00:29.083 --> 00:00:35.802
MATT: Hey guys, I'm the one with Critical Tape
tonight, so. Critical Tape on our fantastic sconce

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:42.688
there. Spare no expense. Anyway. So before we go
ahead and jump in tonight, I want to give a big

00:00:42.688 --> 00:00:48.043
thanks and Sam's going to back me up on this for
our sponsor for tonight's episode, Backblaze.

00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:51.199
(cheering)

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:52.996
MATT: Sam, why don't you tell us all about that,
please?

00:00:52.996 --> 00:00:59.350
SAM: Guys, I'm a little disappointed tonight,
because I prepared an epic presentation tonight.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.383
It was multimedia, there were song elements, there
were rhyming-verse sonnets, I wrote a great poem

00:01:05.383 --> 00:01:10.630
about how Backblaze is unlimited and you can get
it for just five dollars a month, about how it

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.492
backs up-- you get all your data anywhere in the
world, on the web or on your phones, and you can

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:22.515
get a full-featured preview of it by going to
backblaze.com/criticalrole, I wrote all this stuff

00:01:22.515 --> 00:01:28.630
down on my laptop, but my laptop had a
catastrophic hard drive failure today, and I didn't

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:35.097
back it up with Backblaze. And this is what I'm
talking about, guys, this is my art that I made,

00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:39.432
my art, there was a whole piece about you that
would've brought you to tears, you'll never get to

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:40.471
hear any of it.

00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:41.988
TRAVIS: What about me?

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:46.398
SAM: There was nothing about you. But it was
beautiful artwork that I made that you'll never

00:01:46.398 --> 00:01:52.286
get to hear. However, I do remember one little
piece of it. I wrote this song, from scratch,

00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:57.866
about Backblaze. It's an original piece not based
on any Broadway musical, and it goes like this:

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:16.908
(singing) 525,600 fanfics, 525,000 doodles of
Grog, 525,000 nudies of Percleth, how do you back

00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:31.345
up a Critter's hard drive? How about Backblaze!
How about Backblaze! Sam wrote this song.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:32.575
Okay, good, that's it.

00:02:32.575 --> 00:02:34.033
(cheering)

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:40.330
TRAVIS: Oh, so in love with you right now.
Backblaze never sounded so good. Holy shit.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.441
MATT: Let's have a very, very brief moment of
silence for your hard drive. Thank you, that was

00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:48.003
great. All right.

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:51.916
TRAVIS: My musical boner for you is super rigid
right now.

00:02:51.916 --> 00:02:56.464
SAM: Oh yeah? You would be even more hard if you
knew that I was talking to Lin-Manuel today.

00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:57.781
LAURA and TRAVIS: (gasp)

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.327
LAURA: No you were not. Is that part of
announcements?

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:03.200
SAM: No, that's just a little humblebrag.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.457
LAURA: You mother-- wow.

00:03:07.457 --> 00:03:09.675
SAM: We should probably run that intro, right?

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:12.344
MATT: Yeah, in just a second.

00:03:12.344 --> 00:03:13.958
LAURA: So we can hear about it!

00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:15.456
TRAVIS: You're full of shit, right?

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:23.720
MATT: All right, other announcements, I wanted to
say real fast, it got posted in the Anime Florida

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.567
convention that's this weekend, I did say unfortunately I
had to cancel on the event due to personal

00:03:30.567 --> 00:03:33.952
reasons. I'm sorry I can't be there, but they have
a lot of great guests. Please go, have fun, check

00:03:33.952 --> 00:03:36.276
it out, it's going to be great. I'm going to make
it up to you guys, since there are thankfully

00:03:36.276 --> 00:03:39.823
plenty of conventions in Florida throughout the
year, so I plan to be out there really soon and

00:03:39.823 --> 00:03:46.085
will get a chance to make it up to you guys in
person. Anyway. Sorry about that. Much love, and

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:52.169
let's get into this episode. So everyone ready?
Everyone set? We had a few levels, actually. We

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.239
had Vex, Vax, Grog, and Keyleth, all hit level
15.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.787
SAM: Whoa. What's up with us?

00:03:57.787 --> 00:03:59.006
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.406
MARISHA: We're gods now.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.099
TRAVIS: I'm the smartest man alive.

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.025
MARISHA: I have my 8th-level spell.

00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:05.724
LAURA: (gasps) Do you really?

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:06.855
MARISHA: Yeah I do.

00:04:06.855 --> 00:04:09.896
LAURA: Can we know what you took? No, that's got
to be a surprise.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:11.565
MARISHA: I get them all.

00:04:11.565 --> 00:04:13.519
LAURA: Oh, you don't have to choose?

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.842
MATT: Well, she has to choose at the beginning of
each day.

00:04:16.842 --> 00:04:18.545
LAURA: Fucking rangers.

00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:20.028
LIAM: I multiclassed into monk.

00:04:20.028 --> 00:04:21.443
LAURA: No you didn't.

00:04:21.443 --> 00:04:25.550
I took the second level in rogue, though.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.040
SAM: Oh yeah? Do you get a rogue spell?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.021
LAURA: I don't get any rogue spells, but I do get
to disengage now.

00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:32.331
MARISHA: You so sneaky.

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:34.496
TRAVIS: And she gets to sleep with barbarians
whenever she wants.

00:04:34.496 --> 00:04:35.769
SAM: Ew.

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.863
(laughter)

00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:40.999
TALIESIN: Somehow no new information, yet still
TMI.

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:46.222
MATT: And on that note, let's dive into tonight's
episode of Critical Role.

00:04:46.222 --> 00:06:17.374
[dramatic music]

00:06:17.374 --> 00:06:22.803
MATT: Welcome back, everyone. So. Last time we
left off, Vox Machina, in their attempt to gain

00:06:22.803 --> 00:06:27.119
power through artifacts called the Vestiges of
Divergence, to eventually destroy the Chroma

00:06:27.119 --> 00:06:32.777
Conclave, great evil dragons that came together to
terrorize the Tal'Dorei countryside, they were

00:06:32.777 --> 00:06:40.576
seeking one in the country-- continent of Marquet,
the city of Ank'harel. After traveling there and

00:06:40.576 --> 00:06:45.732
meeting with members of the various
establishments, the new culture they were

00:06:45.732 --> 00:06:57.346
introduced to, a drug deal gone awry, some time in
a casino, some hookah excursions and some terrible

00:06:57.346 --> 00:07:06.543
alcohol purchases, they found themselves finding
an ally in the current head and for the past 400

00:07:06.543 --> 00:07:13.629
years the head of the city of Ank'harel known as
J'mon Sa Ord. They gave the party their allegiance

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:18.875
in this endeavor against the Conclave and
presented them with a brass flute that apparently

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:28.830
can at least notify that the aid is required.
After which the party spent the evening in their

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.915
tavern after the casino incident and then went
searching for this individual, this Mistress

00:07:33.915 --> 00:07:40.450
Asharu who apparently has the Cabal's Ruin, this
next Vestige in your journey. Upon checking in her

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:46.531
house after having no response for a couple days,
you broke inside to find that the home had been

00:07:46.531 --> 00:07:55.126
attacked as of a week ago, her body left behind,
apparently riddled with puncture wounds, seemingly

00:07:55.126 --> 00:08:01.882
bullet holes after your inspection, Percy, and
Cabal's Ruin, the cloak that you were seeking, is

00:08:01.882 --> 00:08:10.402
gone. And that is where we left off. So. Diving
back in, you've had the information synced to you

00:08:10.402 --> 00:08:17.447
that Mistress Asharru's been destroyed, Cabal's
Ruin is gone. You went and checked out the small

00:08:17.447 --> 00:08:23.281
back exit that led to one of the other streets of
the city, essentially another way out of the

00:08:23.281 --> 00:08:27.538
house. That's all the information you have right
now, and you're all trying to wrap your head

00:08:27.538 --> 00:08:31.110
around what just happened and what the next steps
are. What do you want to do?

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.450
LAURA: We're still in the house?

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:33.879
MATT: You're still in the house, yes.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:43.190
LAURA: I'm a little nervous that the trap that
went off on the front door was an alarm system.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.421
SAM: Sure.

00:08:44.421 --> 00:08:45.814
LAURA: For whoever left.

00:08:45.814 --> 00:08:47.198
TALIESIN: It might be.

00:08:47.198 --> 00:08:48.683
TRAVIS: With the cloak?

00:08:48.683 --> 00:09:00.316
SAM: Or it could've been Cloaky's alarm system
that means that whoever killed Cloaky got in

00:09:00.316 --> 00:09:02.085
through not the front door.

00:09:02.085 --> 00:09:04.391
LAURA: Yeah, but we saw a trail of blood leading
to the front door.

00:09:04.391 --> 00:09:08.242
SAM: That was her trying to get out after she was
stabbed to death, right? No?

00:09:08.242 --> 00:09:11.240
LAURA: No, I think it was the blood from--

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:15.443
TRAVIS: Yeah, otherwise she walked back in her
individual footsteps and then laid down.

00:09:15.443 --> 00:09:18.215
SAM: You're right, that is better detective work
than mine.

00:09:18.215 --> 00:09:23.425
LAURA: I think. I mean, I think that it was--

00:09:23.425 --> 00:09:31.398
SAM: But how'd they get out without-- so whoever
the murderer is set the trap as he/she was

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:32.407
leaving.

00:09:32.407 --> 00:09:34.405
TRAVIS: The murderer who's shooting bullets.

00:09:34.405 --> 00:09:39.945
LIAM: Is there anything gained by discussing this
here? Do we need to look any further, or should we

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:41.463
get the hell out?

00:09:41.463 --> 00:09:45.246
TALIESIN: One last quick glance around the room to
see if there's anything helpful.

00:09:45.246 --> 00:09:47.451
MARISHA: Percy, can I see your gun?

00:09:47.451 --> 00:09:50.111
TALIESIN: I hand it to her without even thinking
about it.

00:09:50.111 --> 00:09:52.976
MARISHA: I inspect--

00:09:52.976 --> 00:09:54.867
TALIESIN: (gasps) You're a genius.

00:09:54.867 --> 00:09:56.844
MATT: Make an investigation check.

00:09:56.844 --> 00:09:59.690
MARISHA: (sighs) I'm so bad at these.

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.513
MATT: What are you trying to find?

00:10:01.513 --> 00:10:06.760
MARISHA: I want to see if there's a gem or device
on it, like a tracking device.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.469
MATT: Sure, go for it.

00:10:08.469 --> 00:10:11.209
TALIESIN: I'd be very impressed if there was.

00:10:11.209 --> 00:10:13.517
MARISHA: Oh, shit. 20.

00:10:13.517 --> 00:10:20.127
MATT: 20. You inspect the gun, and the gun, almost
like a pearled handle in a weapon, has whitestone

00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:25.798
inlay and certain portions of the actual weapon
contain pockets of whitestone. Upon getting closer

00:10:25.798 --> 00:10:32.456
to it and-- you're perturbed as she begins to
inspect closely and you see her face open up with

00:10:32.456 --> 00:10:38.145
reaction. It's probably been a while since you've
missed a detail that Keyleth picked up on your own

00:10:38.145 --> 00:10:51.677
item. There is a very, very faint magical aura on
the piece of whitestone that's underneath the main

00:10:51.677 --> 00:10:59.903
set of barrels on the front, and there is-- the
carved signature of Ripley across the bottom does

00:10:59.903 --> 00:11:02.291
give off a faint magical glow.

00:11:02.291 --> 00:11:04.161
LAURA: She's been fucking tracking us?

00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:06.099
LIAM: What're you looking at there, Keyleth?

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:07.747
TRAVIS: Oh, no.

00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:11.064
MARISHA: I think Percy was right. I think she has
been spying on us.

00:11:11.064 --> 00:11:15.375
TRAVIS: Well, Scanlan, throw it in the acid.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:18.161
(laughter)

00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:20.486
SAM: Better give me the gun.

00:11:20.486 --> 00:11:24.729
MARISHA: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, I can use this,
if it's--

00:11:24.729 --> 00:11:28.085
SAM: Can you reverse lookup on the telephone?

00:11:28.085 --> 00:11:30.514
MARISHA: Yeah, I can scry through it.

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:33.913
TALIESIN: You can scry?

00:11:33.913 --> 00:11:37.156
MARISHA: And she was very attached to it, which
means it should work pretty well.

00:11:37.156 --> 00:11:40.832
MATT: In theory, you can scry on anybody that
you've met as well, as long as you know about them.

00:11:40.832 --> 00:11:44.302
MARISHA: I've also met her, so that helps.

00:11:44.302 --> 00:11:48.755
MATT: I would give that a bonus to the actual
roll.

00:11:48.755 --> 00:11:51.242
TRAVIS: I agree with what Vax is going to say, we
should move.

00:11:51.242 --> 00:11:54.088
LIAM: Yeah, if anyone wants to roll this place, do
it, and let's get out of here.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:59.486
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a quick look around,
quickly, quickly. Investigation, or? It doesn't

00:11:59.486 --> 00:12:00.851
matter, that was a terrible roll.

00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:02.229
MATT: What are you looking for?

00:12:02.229 --> 00:12:07.858
TALIESIN: Clues, objects, I'm basically doing the
standard police tumble. I'm tossing the place.

00:12:07.858 --> 00:12:09.774
MATT: What'd you roll?

00:12:09.774 --> 00:12:11.671
TALIESIN: I rolled a nine.

00:12:11.671 --> 00:12:18.836
MATT: A nine. You angrily begin throwing things
around the room in a fit. But you're so unfocused in

00:12:18.836 --> 00:12:24.901
your search, it's less about the actual search and
more about the frustration that this bypassed your

00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:28.997
attention for so long, and you guys watch as Percy
begins to throw the bed to the side and go through

00:12:28.997 --> 00:12:32.169
and start shoving stuff off of counters, and he's
not really looking for anything, he's just trying

00:12:32.169 --> 00:12:34.871
to deal with his pent-up frustration.

00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:39.443
MARISHA: Percy. We should go. This isn't helping
anything.

00:12:39.443 --> 00:12:46.503
TALIESIN: Yes. Yes. Yes. Better to do that in here
than outside. Secret passage?

00:12:46.503 --> 00:12:51.711
LIAM: Yeah, it's this way. I think I checked for
traps last--

00:12:51.711 --> 00:12:54.113
LAURA: Because you already went up to the top.

00:12:54.113 --> 00:12:55.983
LIAM: Yeah. I went all the way to the top and
peeked around.

00:12:55.983 --> 00:13:00.159
MATT: Yeah, there were no traps and you managed to
make it through below the small--

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:06.225
LIAM: I had a look around. Is it public, or off to
the side?

00:13:06.225 --> 00:13:11.510
MATT: It's a small alley that leads into an open
public space, so as long as you listen out for

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:13.448
anybody in the vicinity, you can--

00:13:13.448 --> 00:13:15.061
LIAM: I'm going to scurry up, open up--

00:13:15.061 --> 00:13:20.860
MATT: Okay, go ahead and make a perception check.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:22.647
LIAM: 20. No, 22.

00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:29.650
MATT: 22. Okay. You go up these small handholds as
you go up to the top, and there's a little bit of

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:36.418
a grate that's pushed there, you push it open, and
the metal circle plops on the side. You find that

00:13:36.418 --> 00:13:41.190
there's actually a piece of thin cloth that's
covering it as you push it over, and you listen up

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:47.410
for a second. You hear the bustle on the outside
of the city, but you do not notice anyone paying

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.895
attention to it, and you use the right moment to
dart up and you begin taking watch for the

00:13:50.895 --> 00:13:51.918
rest of the party.

00:13:51.918 --> 00:13:55.041
LIAM: I'm off to the side like Marion in Raiders,
to the side of the alley.

00:13:55.041 --> 00:14:01.729
LAURA: Before I leave the room, can I check to see
if it seems like Ripley was alone or if there were

00:14:01.729 --> 00:14:02.872
other people?

00:14:02.872 --> 00:14:07.223
MATT: Make a survival check.

00:14:07.223 --> 00:14:08.766
LAURA: Natural 20.

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:11.162
TRAVIS: First one of the night.

00:14:11.162 --> 00:14:15.120
MATT: While you guys are having this conversation,
Vex is occasionally chiming in this whole time,

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:20.263
but is also keeping a very close eye on her own
mental layout of how the actual scuffle happened,

00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:24.929
looking for signs of impact. You actually follow
the footprints where someone smeared in the blood

00:14:24.929 --> 00:14:29.755
and tracked it up. There are varying foot sizes in
some of the tracks you can see pressed in the

00:14:29.755 --> 00:14:34.154
dust, and there was a layer of dust down here
within certain areas because portions of the room

00:14:34.154 --> 00:14:41.027
are not often trekked. In fact, you see from the
general dust that's settled, there's a track from

00:14:41.027 --> 00:14:44.495
the bed to a couple of shelves to the table and
the exit, and you get the idea that Mistress

00:14:44.495 --> 00:14:51.987
Asharru, being as trained as she was, she had a
pattern and outside that pattern that she walked,

00:14:51.987 --> 00:14:55.998
there is a pretty heavy layer of dust that
gathered in those areas of the room, and those

00:14:55.998 --> 00:15:00.924
areas had been disturbed in some ways, and you
gather based on the footprints that are there,

00:15:00.924 --> 00:15:05.794
there were at least five or six people in the room
when this went down.

00:15:05.794 --> 00:15:08.097
LIAM: Terminator overlay.

00:15:08.097 --> 00:15:14.524
LAURA: All right. Grog?

00:15:14.524 --> 00:15:15.448
TRAVIS: Yeah?

00:15:15.448 --> 00:15:17.279
LAURA: Can I have some of that Dust of
Tracelessness?

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:19.725
TRAVIS: What, are you going to mix it with some
spice and get high?

00:15:19.725 --> 00:15:21.180
LAURA: Definitely.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:22.474
TRAVIS: Yup, here you go.

00:15:22.474 --> 00:15:26.955
LAURA: Can I sprinkle it around so that they can't
track us in the room, having been here?

00:15:26.955 --> 00:15:31.614
MATT: Yeah. And as you throw around the dust, all
the tracks, everything that gave a sign of the

00:15:31.614 --> 00:15:36.458
previous invaders, vanishes slowly as the dust
begins to cover the entirety of the floor, and as

00:15:36.458 --> 00:15:40.400
you guys leave the same. It looks weirdly
undisturbed other than the body lying there with

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:43.525
now no actual ability to track how it got there.

00:15:43.525 --> 00:15:49.807
SAM: That's tampering with evidence. That's a
definite felony.

00:15:49.807 --> 00:15:54.093
LAURA: Definitely. Not as bad a felony as shoving
spice up your ass, but...

00:15:54.093 --> 00:15:59.318
SAM: I don't know what you're talking about. That
was a scientific experiment.

00:15:59.318 --> 00:16:04.052
LIAM: It was fucking awesome. Are we getting out
of here, or are we going to get out of here?

00:16:04.052 --> 00:16:05.875
LAURA: Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:05.875 --> 00:16:12.762
MATT: Okay. You all eventually make your way to the end
of the secret tunnel, Vax leads you up at times when it's

00:16:12.762 --> 00:16:17.244
least likely to be noticed in the alleyway, and
eventually you all make yourselves up into the

00:16:17.244 --> 00:16:21.871
top, close off the entrance, and then are hiding
off, and then carefully, nonchalantly make your

00:16:21.871 --> 00:16:26.182
way into the main thoroughfare up here. And it
isn't a large street, it's one of the secondary

00:16:26.182 --> 00:16:30.153
side-streets. Occasionally you have a person that
comes by with a large cart, or a couple people

00:16:30.153 --> 00:16:35.638
walking arm-in-arm, but no one seems to pay any
attention or notice your alleyway entry, and you

00:16:35.638 --> 00:16:39.800
have successfully obscured yourself within the
rest of the denizens of Ank'harel.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.608
TALIESIN: Can you find her without her knowing?

00:16:42.608 --> 00:16:48.941
MARISHA: I mean, all magic has a risk factor
depending on--

00:16:48.941 --> 00:16:51.931
SAM: We have to look. Otherwise we have no leads
at all.

00:16:51.931 --> 00:16:53.769
LIAM: Let's head back to the Debt's Respite.

00:16:53.769 --> 00:16:56.456
LAURA: And get ready to leave, because we can't
hang around--

00:16:56.456 --> 00:16:58.826
TALIESIN: Talk to her employer so they know it
wasn't us.

00:16:58.826 --> 00:17:03.765
SAM: Wait, wait. Should we not scry from a
different place than the place we're staying at?

00:17:03.765 --> 00:17:05.787
TALIESIN: It's the place that she knows we are
already.

00:17:05.787 --> 00:17:07.023
TRAVIS: True.

00:17:07.023 --> 00:17:09.716
TALIESIN: She knows exactly where we're standing
anywhere we're holding the bloody gun.

00:17:09.716 --> 00:17:13.696
TRAVIS: And when we do, we should set a little
ambush in case it sets off any alarms.

00:17:13.696 --> 00:17:16.001
LAURA: Can she hear us? When you scry, can you
hear?

00:17:16.001 --> 00:17:21.138
SAM: Yeah, you can.

00:17:21.138 --> 00:17:27.034
MARISHA: I can hear, but I don't think they can
hear me. It's like looking through a little

00:17:27.034 --> 00:17:28.310
window.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.472
LAURA: Yeah, so if we're talking about her right
now, she can hear--

00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:34.688
MARISHA: I don't know how this runic magic works
on his gun.

00:17:34.688 --> 00:17:39.007
MATT: Yeah, you're not sure what the actual
enchantment is. It's subtle.

00:17:39.007 --> 00:17:42.342
MARISHA: This is something different than what I
would be doing.

00:17:42.342 --> 00:17:46.383
LIAM: I grab Keyleth's hand and pull the gun over
and say, but for now, we assume she can hear

00:17:46.383 --> 00:17:48.279
everything that we are saying.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:49.552
TRAVIS: Ripley's a piece of shit.

00:17:49.552 --> 00:17:50.983
LAURA: You're a piece of shit. You're ugly.

00:17:50.983 --> 00:17:53.174
LIAM: Percival's going to fucking murder you.

00:17:53.174 --> 00:17:57.007
MARISHA: You're not that ugly. She just meant that
to hurt your feelings.

00:17:57.007 --> 00:17:59.573
TRAVIS: Keyleth, don't soften the blow. She's a
piece of shit.

00:17:59.573 --> 00:18:01.417
MARISHA: But you are a piece of shit.

00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:02.539
TRAVIS: Nice job.

00:18:02.539 --> 00:18:05.539
(laughter)

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:09.801
SAM: It's The Wire. Except terrible.

00:18:09.801 --> 00:18:13.807
MATT: Omar's challenge rating 30.

00:18:13.807 --> 00:18:19.011
MARISHA: Was Ripley a magic-user, did she ever
engage in magic?

00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:22.064
TALIESIN: Not that I really was aware. I didn't
know her that well.

00:18:22.064 --> 00:18:28.760
SAM: We know that she used some magic. She
disguised her hand with some illusion spell.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.304
TALIESIN: Nothing complex.

00:18:32.304 --> 00:18:38.695
MATT: She disguised her hand, she also a short
distance seemingly teleported or managed to break

00:18:38.695 --> 00:18:42.803
away from you guys and Trinket to make
her escape.

00:18:42.803 --> 00:18:48.411
TRAVIS: If she's anything like you, she might've
paid someone to magically upgrade it for her.

00:18:48.411 --> 00:18:50.343
TALIESIN: She is like me.

00:18:50.343 --> 00:18:53.992
LIAM: She's also potentially listening to us right
now, I mean, time is of the essence.

00:18:53.992 --> 00:18:56.456
TALIESIN: Let's head back to the tavern.

00:18:56.456 --> 00:19:02.803
MATT: Okay, you guys make your way back to the
Debt's Respite. You head back up to your rooms,

00:19:02.803 --> 00:19:07.057
and you have a relative private space to go ahead
and discuss the next portion of your plan.

00:19:07.057 --> 00:19:09.486
SAM: Do we leave the gun outside the room?

00:19:09.486 --> 00:19:12.171
TALIESIN: We have more than one room, right?

00:19:12.171 --> 00:19:13.472
MATT: You have three rooms.

00:19:13.472 --> 00:19:15.755
TALIESIN: Can we leave the gun with Trinket in the
other room?

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:19.545
MARISHA: I don't know if he's qualified to handle
firearms.

00:19:19.545 --> 00:19:22.464
TALIESIN: That's precisely why I want to leave the
gun with Trinket in the other room.

00:19:22.464 --> 00:19:26.715
LAURA: He won't shoot it. He'll sit on it. Is there
a safety?

00:19:26.715 --> 00:19:29.222
TALIESIN: It's not loaded, it's all right.

00:19:29.222 --> 00:19:31.223
SAM: You could always put it in the Bag of
Holding.

00:19:31.223 --> 00:19:33.356
LIAM: I mean, Percival, be sure there's nothing in
the gun, please.

00:19:33.356 --> 00:19:36.103
TALIESIN: It's so complex to make it work, it's
fine.

00:19:36.103 --> 00:19:38.959
MARISHA: If Trinket shoots himself in the ass...

00:19:38.959 --> 00:19:40.040
TALIESIN: It would be very funny, but--

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.248
LAURA: He won't.

00:19:41.248 --> 00:19:43.351
TRAVIS: What do you want to do with it now? What's
the plan?

00:19:43.351 --> 00:19:46.257
TALIESIN: We're going to leave it with Trinket in
the other room for the moment, and we're going to

00:19:46.257 --> 00:19:50.700
discuss things. Leaving it under the bed with a
bear in the room.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:52.655
LAURA: Trinket, sit on the bed.

00:19:52.655 --> 00:19:54.876
MATT: (bear noises)

00:19:54.876 --> 00:20:00.940
LAURA: If anybody walks in the room that's not one
of us, well. Make them very scared and make sure they--

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.244
SAM: Shoot them with the gun.

00:20:02.244 --> 00:20:03.952
LAURA: (laughs) Shoot them with the gun.

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:07.735
MATT: Licks the side of your face and gets back in
a restful period with the front of his paws and

00:20:07.735 --> 00:20:11.062
his head leaning over the edge of the bed, and the
bed itself is bowing under his weight.

00:20:11.062 --> 00:20:13.123
LAURA: Don't you fall asleep.

00:20:13.123 --> 00:20:18.990
MATT: All right, so you guys head to one of the
other rooms, then?

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.634
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:20:20.634 --> 00:20:23.679
MATT: Okay. You guys close the door behind you.

00:20:23.679 --> 00:20:26.585
TRAVIS: Should I keep watch outside?

00:20:26.585 --> 00:20:29.263
LIAM: Yeah, that's a good idea.

00:20:29.263 --> 00:20:31.819
TRAVIS: I'll stand watch outside.

00:20:31.819 --> 00:20:34.320
MATT: And you do, Grog. This hallway is yours.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.231
LAURA: Don't you fall asleep, Grog.

00:20:39.231 --> 00:20:42.686
TRAVIS: (snoring)

00:20:42.686 --> 00:20:45.351
MATT: All right.

00:20:45.351 --> 00:20:53.424
TALIESIN: I think we need to tell her employer
that we are not responsible. As we were the last

00:20:53.424 --> 00:20:58.768
people to attempt to employ her, suspicion
automatically falls on us, and we need to let them

00:20:58.768 --> 00:21:01.833
know immediately that it was not us.

00:21:01.833 --> 00:21:05.003
LIAM: All right. Should we scry now, though?

00:21:05.003 --> 00:21:14.003
MARISHA: I have to study and then sleep on it,
because that's how my process works.

00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:17.534
(laughter)

00:21:17.534 --> 00:21:19.439
TALIESIN: Fucking method.

00:21:19.439 --> 00:21:21.289
LAURA: Okay, yeah.

00:21:21.289 --> 00:21:22.675
MATT: You do have an item.

00:21:22.675 --> 00:21:24.407
MARISHA: Oh my god! I have that thing you gave
me.

00:21:24.407 --> 00:21:25.778
LAURA: The ball, yeah, that I gave you.

00:21:25.778 --> 00:21:27.029
TRAVIS: You have one ball?

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:28.708
LIAM: You have been holding out on us.

00:21:28.708 --> 00:21:30.528
LAURA: Just the one ball, though.

00:21:30.528 --> 00:21:31.917
MARISHA: I have a secret.

00:21:31.917 --> 00:21:33.265
SAM: Vax's face.

00:21:33.265 --> 00:21:44.620
LIAM: It's not necessarily a bad thing. Anything
is workable. Stupid.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.406
TALIESIN: Bless you.

00:21:46.406 --> 00:21:50.494
MARISHA: What is it that I got? I have a little
ball--

00:21:50.494 --> 00:21:52.196
LAURA: The ball of seeing. The ball of scrying.

00:21:52.196 --> 00:21:54.630
MARISHA: Scrying Eye! I have the Scrying Eye.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.676
MATT: There you go.

00:21:55.676 --> 00:21:57.093
SAM: (singing) Scrying eyes--

00:21:57.093 --> 00:21:59.199
ALL: (singing) -- are watching you.

00:21:59.199 --> 00:22:00.604
SAM: (singing) They see your...

00:22:00.604 --> 00:22:02.101
MATT: Anyone have the item card for the--

00:22:02.101 --> 00:22:03.326
MARISHA: I have it.

00:22:03.326 --> 00:22:06.982
MATT: Oh, you do? Great. So yeah, it allows you to
basically do the equivalent of a scry spell once

00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:08.369
per day.

00:22:08.369 --> 00:22:09.527
MARISHA: Once a day.

00:22:09.527 --> 00:22:10.569
MATT: Yeah, all right.

00:22:10.569 --> 00:22:11.922
MARISHA: Do we want to do this here?

00:22:11.922 --> 00:22:13.390
LIAM: I think as soon as possible.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.761
TALIESIN: I think the question is, do we tell them
and see if we can enlist some help with this now

00:22:17.761 --> 00:22:19.009
or wait until after we know--

00:22:19.009 --> 00:22:20.220
SAM: Tell who?

00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.766
MARISHA: I mean, this is going to take me ten
minutes. This is going to take me a second.

00:22:22.766 --> 00:22:26.027
SAM: Let's find out where she is. If she's still
in the city, we can maybe hunt her down and track

00:22:26.027 --> 00:22:27.186
her down today.

00:22:27.186 --> 00:22:30.995
TALIESIN: Do we get any help before we do that,
though? From her employers?

00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:33.477
LAURA: We'll talk to... Treev?

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.526
MARISHA: You guys figure it out, I'm going to
start scrying.

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:42.003
TALIESIN: Figure out where she's going, what she's
doing, how many of them. All these things. I'm

00:22:42.003 --> 00:22:43.111
sorry.

00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:45.720
LAURA: Percy, we'll find her.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.071
TALIESIN: That's what I'm worried about.

00:22:48.071 --> 00:22:50.371
MATT: All right, so without the gun you don't get
the bonus from the item focus.

00:22:50.371 --> 00:22:51.356
MARISHA: Oh, fuck.

00:22:51.356 --> 00:22:53.232
MATT: But you also have the gun not in your
presence.

00:22:53.232 --> 00:22:57.687
MARISHA: Do we want to have the gun for this?
Actually, yeah. I'll do that. I'm going to go in

00:22:57.687 --> 00:22:59.724
the other room, grab the gun, and scry.

00:22:59.724 --> 00:23:02.998
LAURA: I'm going to go sit with you while you
scry.

00:23:02.998 --> 00:23:05.920
MATT: Okay, you go into the room, and as you walk
toward the bed, Trinket growls at you.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.504
LAURA: Trinket.

00:23:07.504 --> 00:23:13.097
TALIESIN: I have another option. I have another
option. We still have her notes. We still have her notes.

00:23:13.097 --> 00:23:15.312
MARISHA: Does anything help?

00:23:15.312 --> 00:23:21.777
MATT: I mean, an object of which has some close
contact with the individual could help, yeah.

00:23:21.777 --> 00:23:22.850
MARISHA: Sure, whatever.

00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:24.741
TALIESIN: It is her diary notes of how to build my
gun.

00:23:24.741 --> 00:23:26.741
MATT: Yeah. You can use that instead, if you
wanted.

00:23:26.741 --> 00:23:28.318
LAURA: So we're not in the room with Trinket.

00:23:28.318 --> 00:23:29.603
MARISHA: Can I use both?

00:23:29.603 --> 00:23:31.390
MATT: They would not overlap.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.520
MARISHA: Oh.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.549
LAURA: Trinket, you keep doing your thing.

00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:35.938
MATT: (bear noises)

00:23:35.938 --> 00:23:38.451
LAURA: All right, let's go back to the other room
and let's get something else to--

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:42.116
MARISHA: I don't know, what do you think would be
better, her notes or?

00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.762
TALIESIN: Her notes. Let's be safe.

00:23:43.762 --> 00:23:45.448
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to use her notes.

00:23:45.448 --> 00:23:51.771
MATT: Okay. That will add five to the DC modifier.
So what's the DC of the spell?

00:23:51.771 --> 00:23:55.691
MARISHA: My spell save DC is 19.

00:23:55.691 --> 00:24:01.431
MATT: All right, so now it's 24 to try and resist
this, as I throw my d20 into oblivion. Fuck that

00:24:01.431 --> 00:24:03.365
dice. I didn't need it.

00:24:03.365 --> 00:24:05.759
LAURA: Do you want one? I have a bag.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:11.811
MATT: You know, I'll use the big one, then, that
Chris Perkins gave me.

00:24:11.811 --> 00:24:13.646
TRAVIS: And thus ends Vox Machina.

00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:25.289
MATT: DM power. All right, then. This is now
Ripley's wisdom saving throw. Hm, okay.

00:24:25.289 --> 00:24:26.737
TRAVIS: (laughs) Hm.

00:24:26.737 --> 00:24:28.616
LIAM: Interesting, interesting.

00:24:28.616 --> 00:24:31.029
LAURA: Does that dice go to dice jail?

00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:41.454
MATT: No. As you sit down and focus, you take the
small object in your hand and concentrate with the

00:24:41.454 --> 00:24:45.867
notes in front of you, and you find that thread of
connection between your memory of Ripley, as fuzzy

00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:49.784
in some places as it is, you have a very clear
image of the moments you guys met in Whitestone.

00:24:49.784 --> 00:24:55.621
The notes, you connect those threads, focus on the
object, and then you guys watch as Keyleth's eyes

00:24:55.621 --> 00:25:02.240
dart open once again, clouded over and white. Your
vision pierces above. You can see your

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:09.419
consciousness thrust through the clouds, white
clouds passing by, passing by, and then your

00:25:09.419 --> 00:25:13.730
vision comes back down through the clouds, only
instead of the desert, instead of the mountains,

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:17.973
instead of anything in the nearby area, it's just
ocean. Just ocean.

00:25:17.973 --> 00:25:20.012
LAURA: She's fucking finding another one.

00:25:20.012 --> 00:25:22.641
MATT: Waves seem endless around you.

00:25:22.641 --> 00:25:24.035
MARISHA: Oh no.

00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:28.065
MATT: You emerge once more, your vision moving
before, only now there's a torrential rain

00:25:28.065 --> 00:25:33.427
surrounding you, lightning, thunder clapping. You
are in the center of a very, very heavy storm that

00:25:33.427 --> 00:25:40.763
is tearing across this ocean expanse. A boat
creaks, ropes swing, and you hear voices yell. A

00:25:40.763 --> 00:25:47.215
crew barely holding it together. Standing on the
deck, hooded, you see Ripley, calm, and looking

00:25:47.215 --> 00:25:53.036
out into the horizon. She smiles from beneath her
dark leather cloak, a shimmer of blue energy dimly

00:25:53.036 --> 00:25:59.168
crackling across its inner lining. A voice yells,
"Nothing yet!" And her eyes dart up to the crow's

00:25:59.168 --> 00:26:05.165
nest, then back down to her weapon, a handheld
firearm of slick design, but familiar function.

00:26:05.165 --> 00:26:06.552
Six barrels.

00:26:06.552 --> 00:26:07.880
LIAM: Oh, snap.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:13.284
MATT: Lightning flashes once more in the distance,
followed by a very, very nearby crack of thunder.

00:26:13.284 --> 00:26:19.091
The boat lists for a second as a wave passes under
it, and it catches itself again. She runs to the

00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:23.985
deck to look out across the crashing waves, and
the vision fades back.

00:26:23.985 --> 00:26:25.811
LIAM: That was magical.

00:26:25.811 --> 00:26:29.293
TRAVIS: That was hot. That was hot.

00:26:29.293 --> 00:26:32.313
SAM: Is there any ocean in town?

00:26:32.313 --> 00:26:36.113
MARISHA: Bitch! She is a-- I grab the gun-- you
are a piece of shit!

00:26:36.113 --> 00:26:38.472
LAURA: I thought the gun was under the bed with
Trinket.

00:26:38.472 --> 00:26:42.093
TALIESIN: You've literally just grabbed my hand
and are yelling into it.

00:26:42.093 --> 00:26:44.571
MARISHA: I'm sorry, I'm still a little fuzzy when
I come out of it.

00:26:44.571 --> 00:26:46.444
SAM: Make gun fingers, at least.

00:26:46.444 --> 00:26:52.376
LIAM: What's the matter, what's the matter? What
did you see?

00:26:52.376 --> 00:26:55.540
MARISHA: She's going after the other one, she's in
the middle of the fucking ocean.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:59.041
SAM: So she's going for the other Vestige.
Whisper? Is that what's in the ocean?

00:26:59.041 --> 00:27:03.506
LAURA: Whisper's in the ocean. The dagger. Fuck.

00:27:03.506 --> 00:27:05.380
MARISHA: And she had the cloak.

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.508
SAM: And she knows everything that we know.

00:27:07.508 --> 00:27:08.996
TALIESIN: Do you know where she is?

00:27:08.996 --> 00:27:11.633
MARISHA: She's with a crew in the middle of the
ocean, so--

00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:14.654
LAURA: Can we instantly be in the middle of the
ocean with her?

00:27:14.654 --> 00:27:23.568
MARISHA: I can't get us there. There's no trees in
the middle of the ocean.

00:27:23.568 --> 00:27:25.455
TALIESIN: She's heading for an island, though.

00:27:25.455 --> 00:27:26.682
LAURA: Is she?

00:27:26.682 --> 00:27:28.946
LIAM: I thought it was beneath the waves.

00:27:28.946 --> 00:27:30.387
SAM: It's in the Ozmit Sea.

00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:31.772
LIAM: Yeah, beneath the Ozmit Sea.

00:27:31.772 --> 00:27:34.560
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you get us there?

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.677
SAM: I can make us all cows. That is about it.

00:27:38.677 --> 00:27:40.461
MARISHA: I mean, I can mist us.

00:27:40.461 --> 00:27:42.361
LAURA: Mist into the ocean?

00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:44.093
MARISHA: We could mist there, but it would
take...

00:27:44.093 --> 00:27:49.952
SAM: (clears throat) Whisper, blade forged from
metal pulled from the Far Realm, was center to

00:27:49.952 --> 00:27:55.575
many dark rituals. Now it lies at the bottom of
the Ozmit Sea, sunken with the lost ship The Shrew

00:27:55.575 --> 00:28:01.538
in a storm 300 years ago, near an island... of trees.

00:28:01.538 --> 00:28:05.474
No, it's an island of grass. There's no trees on
the island.

00:28:05.474 --> 00:28:08.127
MARISHA: No, it's not even an island of grass,
it's an island of glass.

00:28:08.127 --> 00:28:10.333
SAM: Oh, glass! I can't read! (laughs)

00:28:10.333 --> 00:28:12.795
TALIESIN: An island of glass trees.

00:28:12.795 --> 00:28:16.679
SAM: An island of grass.

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:21.372
LIAM: Ah, boy.

00:28:21.372 --> 00:28:23.577
SAM: Island of glass?

00:28:23.577 --> 00:28:28.388
MARISHA: Yeah, which doesn't sound promising, to
be totally honest. So we might have to mist there.

00:28:28.388 --> 00:28:31.251
LIAM: How far away is--

00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:33.725
SAM: It's continents, it would take weeks.

00:28:33.725 --> 00:28:35.403
TRAVIS: Don't they have an airship here?

00:28:35.403 --> 00:28:39.864
MARISHA: Wait, the Water Ashari are in the Ozmit?

00:28:39.864 --> 00:28:42.012
MATT: They're in the Ozmit Sea, yes.

00:28:42.012 --> 00:28:45.505
MARISHA: Do I know if they would be close by this
island of glass?

00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:52.476
MATT: I'm going to go ahead and have... let's see.
Scanlan, roll a history check? And if you could

00:28:52.476 --> 00:28:54.391
roll an intelligence check.

00:28:54.391 --> 00:28:56.000
MARISHA: Why is it always intelligence?

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.170
SAM: I've got a 15 history.

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:00.377
MARISHA: Oh my god. I rolled a natural one.

00:29:00.377 --> 00:29:03.921
MATT: You know it's in the Ozmit Sea, but you've
never been there, you don't know where it is, you

00:29:03.921 --> 00:29:06.393
have no idea what the actual space is there.

00:29:06.393 --> 00:29:08.399
MARISHA: We don't communicate.

00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:12.836
MATT: You. Island of glass, and after thinking
about it hard, you're like, of course, it's the

00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:14.666
Isle of Glintshore.

00:29:14.666 --> 00:29:16.072
LAURA: Of course.

00:29:16.072 --> 00:29:28.296
MATT: It's part of a cluster of islands. You don't
know quite where it is, but you know of it. That's

00:29:28.296 --> 00:29:33.050
about all the information you have on it at the
moment. You don't know how far, the specific

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.880
direction really.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:39.416
SAM: Well, it doesn't look like we can just
magically get to her.

00:29:39.416 --> 00:29:41.063
TRAVIS: Ooh, ooh.

00:29:41.063 --> 00:29:42.440
LAURA: Yes, Grog?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.579
TRAVIS: Aren't you two dweebs always wanting to
steal an airship?

00:29:45.579 --> 00:29:46.605
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

00:29:46.605 --> 00:29:47.640
TRAVIS: Don't they have one here?

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.829
SAM and TALIESIN: Yes.

00:29:48.829 --> 00:29:52.129
TRAVIS: So... Do I have to say the third thing, or
are you going to get there?

00:29:52.129 --> 00:29:55.643
SAM: I would like to steal that airship, but even
then, though, it would take us a week.

00:29:55.643 --> 00:29:58.931
TALIESIN: It would take way too much time. We are
on a schedule.

00:29:58.931 --> 00:30:02.017
TRAVIS: What? Road trip, bitches. Come on. We got
to like, you know--

00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:08.326
SAM: Okay, let's game this out. What's the
worse-case scenario? She has one Vestige. She may

00:30:08.326 --> 00:30:09.446
have two.

00:30:09.446 --> 00:30:10.985
LIAM: What's left after that?

00:30:10.985 --> 00:30:13.548
MARISHA: I mean, we could let her do the hard work
for us.

00:30:13.548 --> 00:30:20.339
LIAM: She has the cloak, that we know of. She's on
top of the dagger almost.

00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:27.607
SAM: The Spire of Conflux, in the Abyssal Plane.
And the Plate of Dawnmartyr in the Elemental Plane

00:30:27.607 --> 00:30:31.386
of Fire. I mean, those are going to be super hard
to find, even for her.

00:30:31.386 --> 00:30:34.917
LIAM: I know, but if we're in an arms race and
she's on top of another, maybe we should head to

00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:37.394
the next that's out of her reach now.

00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:38.497
TRAVIS: That makes sense.

00:30:38.497 --> 00:30:42.774
MARISHA: The staff is in the plane of the Abyss.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:45.026
LAURA: That's a very scary place.

00:30:45.026 --> 00:30:49.767
TRAVIS: The only problem with that is she only has
one now and if she has two, she might be a bit

00:30:49.767 --> 00:30:50.649
harder--

00:30:50.649 --> 00:30:54.315
LAURA: Especially, imagine if one of us was
wearing all of the Vestiges.

00:30:54.315 --> 00:30:58.134
SAM: She has people working for her, clearly.

00:30:58.134 --> 00:31:00.159
LAURA: She's not going to give it up.

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:03.384
SAM: No, but I mean it won't be her alone.

00:31:03.384 --> 00:31:06.906
LIAM: And we're not going to get there in time to
stop her from getting that dagger.

00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:10.313
TALIESIN: But we might be able to take them from
her and perhaps even finally put her down before

00:31:10.313 --> 00:31:13.114
she puts more of those bloody things into the
world.

00:31:13.114 --> 00:31:15.117
MARISHA: Can I also ask another question, Percy?

00:31:15.117 --> 00:31:16.314
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:31:16.314 --> 00:31:20.021
MARISHA: Why does she want these Vestiges in the
first place? I have a feeling she doesn't want to

00:31:20.021 --> 00:31:21.118
fight dragons.

00:31:21.118 --> 00:31:24.107
SAM: She might want to join up with the dragons.

00:31:24.107 --> 00:31:26.347
MARISHA: Do you know?

00:31:26.347 --> 00:31:27.385
TALIESIN: I don't--

00:31:27.385 --> 00:31:30.026
LIAM: I mean, there's many reasons to amass
power.

00:31:30.026 --> 00:31:34.711
LAURA: Could she be the one letting the dragons
know about-- could she be the spy?

00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:43.601
TALIESIN: I spent less than a week in her company
in my life. I know very little about her other

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:53.483
than-- I spent a week in her company and I spent I
don't know how much time trying to track her down

00:31:53.483 --> 00:32:02.575
and all I really know is she's very smart and she
is the worst person I've ever met.

00:32:02.575 --> 00:32:09.493
MARISHA: Why would you say that exactly? Because
we've met a lot of terrible people.

00:32:09.493 --> 00:32:10.651
SAM: Kevdak.

00:32:10.651 --> 00:32:11.829
TALIESIN: People don't frighten me.

00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:13.438
MARISHA: Their dad.

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:14.993
TALIESIN: He doesn't frighten me.

00:32:14.993 --> 00:32:19.980
MARISHA: Saundor was pretty shitty. Clarota.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:24.235
SAM: Well, let's not rank the bad people we've
met.

00:32:24.235 --> 00:32:34.390
TALIESIN: I don't even know if she wants anything.
Maybe she wants nothing.

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:38.193
TRAVIS: Are you genuinely afraid of her?

00:32:38.193 --> 00:32:40.130
TALIESIN: Yes, very much so.

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.775
TRAVIS: Oh.

00:32:41.775 --> 00:32:45.038
LAURA: Fuck, why didn't we kill her when we had
her in our--

00:32:45.038 --> 00:32:47.419
SAM: She got away. We tried.

00:32:47.419 --> 00:32:57.750
TALIESIN: I made a terrible trade. I made the
wrong trade and I made a terrible decision. I know that.

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:02.080
(laughter)

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.650
TALIESIN: The table on the left is completely
incapable--

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.888
TRAVIS: The player on your right--

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:13.552
LIAM: A little mug interference.

00:33:13.552 --> 00:33:22.690
TALIESIN: Let me get this enchantment off my gun.
Let's find somebody who can pull it off and put it

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:28.660
onto something else and leave it here. And then
let's run screaming to this island and see if we

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:36.430
can catch her and if she's not there, we spend 24
hours where I will recount every desperate attempt

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:41.669
I have made to try and kill her in the last few
years of my life and then we head back and deal

00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:45.006
with the other monstrosities that are waiting for
us back home.

00:33:45.006 --> 00:33:47.093
SAM: I don't know that we'll get there in time.

00:33:47.093 --> 00:33:48.755
LIAM: How do we get there?

00:33:48.755 --> 00:33:52.958
MARISHA: We had to fly across the Ozmit Sea to get
to Marquet.

00:33:52.958 --> 00:34:00.096
MATT: It took you about a week to get to
Vasselheim via skyship from Emon and that's

00:34:00.096 --> 00:34:08.951
normally a two-and-a-half week journey by boat.
You guys got to Marquet via your Transport Via

00:34:08.951 --> 00:34:12.302
Plants. Oh no, sorry, you got to Marquet via the
Teleportation Circle that--

00:34:12.302 --> 00:34:14.181
MARISHA: Gilmore made for us.

00:34:14.181 --> 00:34:16.363
LAURA: Are we by the ocean at all?

00:34:16.363 --> 00:34:18.345
MARISHA: But the ocean's above us, right?

00:34:18.345 --> 00:34:23.848
MATT: You have a mountain range that is at the
top, the northern part of the desert, probably a

00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:29.590
day and a half of foot travel and the mountain
range, you're not sure how big that is. From what

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:35.420
you know of loose geography-- Scanlan, you
probably know this better than anybody-- that

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:42.131
Ank'Harel and this part of the desert is not too
far from the northern shore of Marquet, compared

00:34:42.131 --> 00:34:50.892
to the rest of it. The entire continent is like a
big U and this is the Ozmit Sea up here. This is

00:34:50.892 --> 00:34:53.754
Marquet. Ank'Harel's right there and then this is
the ocean.

00:34:53.754 --> 00:34:56.551
LAURA: Can Misty Step travel faster than a boat?

00:34:56.551 --> 00:35:02.051
MATT: Of an ocean boat? Yes, probably twice as
fast.

00:35:02.051 --> 00:35:05.869
LAURA: So if it took her a week to get where she
is now, we could probably get there--

00:35:05.869 --> 00:35:09.266
TALIESIN: In three days. But where do you rest in
the--

00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:11.652
SAM: Yes. We'd have to rest in order to do Misty
Step--

00:35:11.652 --> 00:35:15.413
LIAM: If your magic runs out while we're flying
over the ocean, what happens, we drown?

00:35:15.413 --> 00:35:18.393
LAURA: We don't necessarily drown immediately.

00:35:18.393 --> 00:35:21.473
TALIESIN: Also, if we can find a way to teleport
to the island, if there's a way that we can.

00:35:21.473 --> 00:35:23.360
LIAM: But how?

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.963
SAM: We have one teleportation circle.

00:35:24.963 --> 00:35:26.992
MARISHA: I mean, I could teleport us--

00:35:26.992 --> 00:35:28.498
LIAM: You have to have a circle to a circle.

00:35:28.498 --> 00:35:36.193
MARISHA: I could teleport us to the edge of the
continent, we could sleep, and then Misty Step

00:35:36.193 --> 00:35:37.899
lasts eight hours.

00:35:37.899 --> 00:35:39.341
MATT: Yeah. Wind Walk, you mean?

00:35:39.341 --> 00:35:40.606
MARISHA: Wind Walk, whatever.

00:35:40.606 --> 00:35:43.408
MATT: It's a different spell, but yeah. It's 30
feet.

00:35:43.408 --> 00:35:44.627
LIAM: That wouldn't do it.

00:35:44.627 --> 00:35:45.584
MATT: Little different.

00:35:45.584 --> 00:35:46.926
MARISHA: Wind Walk lasts eight hours.

00:35:46.926 --> 00:35:58.417
SAM: She's on a boat. She's not on a magic boat.
She can't magically get back to the shore without

00:35:58.417 --> 00:36:04.129
sailing there. If we sail out on an airship or a
boat--

00:36:04.129 --> 00:36:05.912
LAURA: We could bomb her!

00:36:05.912 --> 00:36:10.431
SAM: Well yes! She's slow moving, she's on a boat,
it'll take her days to get wherever she's going,

00:36:10.431 --> 00:36:16.117
we need to find her, and we can keep scrying on
the airship, and catch up to her slowly, she's a

00:36:16.117 --> 00:36:18.051
slow moving target, even after she--

00:36:18.051 --> 00:36:19.837
LIAM: I like that you're assuming we'll have an
airship.

00:36:19.837 --> 00:36:23.043
SAM: We don't right now, but we will soon.

00:36:23.043 --> 00:36:25.641
MARISHA: It could take us a while to even get the
airship.

00:36:25.641 --> 00:36:29.478
SAM: Nope. One day. Me and Percy. Maybe two
hours.

00:36:29.478 --> 00:36:35.135
TRAVIS: I actually agree with that strategy. It is
a bit like fish in a barrel because she is limited

00:36:35.135 --> 00:36:36.401
by her speed.

00:36:36.401 --> 00:36:38.283
LAURA: Will we be able to find her in the middle
of the ocean?

00:36:38.283 --> 00:36:39.806
SAM: We can keep scrying from the airship.

00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:40.885
LIAM: That's true.

00:36:40.885 --> 00:36:42.020
TALIESIN: We can keep scrying.

00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.962
TALIESIN: The first thing we have to do is remove
this enchantment and I'm very open to ideas on how

00:36:46.962 --> 00:36:47.864
to do that.

00:36:47.864 --> 00:36:52.476
TRAVIS: Wait, but play it out. How do we see where
she is in comparison to a giant body of water?

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:56.234
SAM: Well, we use what sailors do.

00:36:56.234 --> 00:36:57.634
TRAVIS: Look up at the stars?

00:36:57.634 --> 00:37:00.427
SAM: Up at the stars, right? We scry at night.

00:37:00.427 --> 00:37:03.789
TRAVIS: We're looking at her, right, not up, can
we, like, go like that--

00:37:03.789 --> 00:37:05.178
LAURA: No, you can scry up, yeah.

00:37:05.178 --> 00:37:07.550
MATT: Focused around the target of the scrying.

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.947
LIAM: Are either of you gentlemen smart enough to
do that?

00:37:09.947 --> 00:37:12.123
MARISHA: We can't tilt the camera up a little
bit?

00:37:12.123 --> 00:37:17.053
MATT: No. You can, but you'll see a blurred
skyline--

00:37:17.053 --> 00:37:22.384
SAM: We can listen for clues. Maybe the crew
members will shout out a, "Oh, we're at longitude

00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:25.865
"blah blah blah latitude blah blah blah!"

00:37:25.865 --> 00:37:30.018
MATT: For you, when you scry on something, imagine
it, like, super high depth of field, so like what

00:37:30.018 --> 00:37:34.579
you're looking at is super in-focus and most
everything else is very blurred and out of focus.

00:37:34.579 --> 00:37:42.418
SAM: Okay, wait, to play this out a bit more: we
know where she's going. We know where Glintshore

00:37:42.418 --> 00:37:44.393
is roughly if we got a local--

00:37:44.393 --> 00:37:45.483
LIAM: Do you know where that island is?

00:37:45.483 --> 00:37:49.789
SAM: Well we can find a local who does. A sailor
or something who can help us navigate our way there.

00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:51.410
LAURA: Maybe somebody in an airship.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:55.365
TRAVIS: We could, but we might just be chasing, as
long as we're all right with that. We'll just be

00:37:55.365 --> 00:37:56.609
chasing.

00:37:56.609 --> 00:37:59.482
LAURA: We'll keep scrying until we see if she's
found it.

00:37:59.482 --> 00:38:00.764
TALIESIN: Until we see a tree.

00:38:00.764 --> 00:38:05.010
TRAVIS: Vax does have a point, though. If we're
just chasing, we could get the jump on other ones.

00:38:05.010 --> 00:38:09.671
TALIESIN: Here's the terrifying notion: if you see
a tree in any of your scries, can you teleport to it?

00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:10.880
MARISHA: Yes, I can.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.684
TALIESIN: So as long as she gets next to a tree--

00:38:12.684 --> 00:38:14.449
SAM: I don't think she's getting next to a tree.

00:38:14.449 --> 00:38:15.767
MARISHA: She's in the middle of the ocean.

00:38:15.767 --> 00:38:18.759
TALIESIN: Once she's on the island, if the island
has a tree...

00:38:18.759 --> 00:38:20.583
LAURA and LIAM: It's possible.

00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:24.257
SAM: It was near. It was near the island of
glass.

00:38:24.257 --> 00:38:26.996
TALIESIN: We're going to be looking for her.
That's where I would set up shop if I were--

00:38:26.996 --> 00:38:31.349
LIAM: I mean, Percival is correct, the first thing
we have to do is get that gun unfucked, but then

00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:35.397
after we have to decide if we are chasing her
down-- and it seems 50-50 to me, not impossible,

00:38:35.397 --> 00:38:39.872
but not a sure thing at all-- or do we head to the
next Vestige to keep it out of her hands?

00:38:39.872 --> 00:38:41.299
LAURA: Into the Plane of Abyss?

00:38:41.299 --> 00:38:44.073
LIAM: Well isn't that where we have to go anyway?

00:38:44.073 --> 00:38:47.507
TRAVIS: Let's get the gun unfucked, and we'll
simmer on it.

00:38:47.507 --> 00:38:55.450
SAM: Wait, before we get the gun unfucked, is
there any use to it being fucked? Like, can we

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:01.126
have play-acting conversations around it like "Oh,
this is where we should go next, hope you're

00:39:01.126 --> 00:39:01.949
"listening!"

00:39:01.949 --> 00:39:06.163
TALIESIN: That is deeply assuming that it actually
conveys sound, which it may not.

00:39:06.163 --> 00:39:10.210
MARISHA: Yeah, we have no idea what it actually
is, let's go get it.

00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:14.870
TALIESIN: Yeah, we're going to have to move that
enchantment onto something else.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:18.352
SAM: We can go to that place where-- back to the
asshole.

00:39:18.352 --> 00:39:20.402
TALIESIN: I know what he wants, no.

00:39:20.402 --> 00:39:21.562
SAM: What does he want?

00:39:21.562 --> 00:39:22.599
LAURA: He wants whitestone.

00:39:22.599 --> 00:39:23.837
SAM: So give him whitestone.

00:39:23.837 --> 00:39:24.729
TALIESIN: Absolutely not.

00:39:24.729 --> 00:39:28.455
MARISHA: He's going to take one really close look
at that gun and see a lot of whitestone in it.

00:39:28.455 --> 00:39:30.864
TRAVIS: I got two chunks of whitestone in the Bag
of Holding.

00:39:30.864 --> 00:39:34.448
TALIESIN: He wants the green gems, and I'm not
prepared to make that deal.

00:39:34.448 --> 00:39:40.942
SAM: We can make him a fake one and give it to him
for one favor. We can make a fake gem, how hard is that?

00:39:40.942 --> 00:39:42.076
LAURA: He's going to know.

00:39:42.076 --> 00:39:44.426
TRAVIS: I got a bunch of gems in the Bag of
Holding.

00:39:44.426 --> 00:39:46.837
TALIESIN: It's not going to work.

00:39:46.837 --> 00:39:48.611
LAURA: Do you have green gems?

00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:50.092
TRAVIS: Gems, lots of gems.

00:39:50.092 --> 00:39:52.180
LAURA: No, but the green gems from Whitestone?

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:59.071
LIAM: Whitestone is much further away from the
Ozmit Sea than where we are now, right?

00:39:59.071 --> 00:40:02.808
MATT: Whitestone is &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; further away, yes.

00:40:02.808 --> 00:40:04.652
LIAM: Way, way, other side of the continent
right?

00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:07.623
MATT: Across a vast ocean, and then across the
continent.

00:40:07.623 --> 00:40:18.149
SAM: One thing that occurred to me, that may not
help us at all. Mistress Asharru, the dead girl:

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:23.416
she was part of an organization?

00:40:23.416 --> 00:40:24.561
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:40:24.561 --> 00:40:27.051
SAM: Maybe they would want to help us because of
revenge?

00:40:27.051 --> 00:40:30.731
TALIESIN: Here's the question, and this is what
I've been thinking about sitting here for the last

00:40:30.731 --> 00:40:38.114
few minutes, is either way this is terrible:
either we don't tell them and leave town and

00:40:38.114 --> 00:40:43.662
eventually they find her and she's got strange
holes in her from some strange thing that could

00:40:43.662 --> 00:40:49.846
possibly be a thing that a man with white hair who
breezed through town a week ago was holding, or we

00:40:49.846 --> 00:40:56.859
go and tell them, and I cannot believe this is
about to come out of my mouth, that it wasn't me,

00:40:56.859 --> 00:41:00.077
it was a one armed woman, who had--

00:41:00.077 --> 00:41:01.572
SAM: A fugitive?

00:41:01.572 --> 00:41:08.271
TALIESIN: An identical, thank you, weapon, of this
one of a kind weapon that no one bloody saw.

00:41:08.271 --> 00:41:13.174
LAURA: No, but here's the thing, maybe somebody
did see her.

00:41:13.174 --> 00:41:17.119
TALIESIN: Maybe somebody did see her, and maybe
they'll know where to get the gun.

00:41:17.119 --> 00:41:23.978
MARISHA: Even if they did see her, we know she
knows how to alter her appearance. Also, no

00:41:23.978 --> 00:41:29.182
offense Percy, but I feel like we need to be
careful on who you expose that gun to, from here

00:41:29.182 --> 00:41:30.051
on out.

00:41:30.051 --> 00:41:31.402
TALIESIN: I am keenly aware.

00:41:31.402 --> 00:41:37.160
MARISHA: Not only, one, for people who might think
you're the culprit, but two, for people who are

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.445
going to want to rip you off again.

00:41:39.445 --> 00:41:45.318
TALIESIN: She's the only person who's ever gotten
a good look at it. She's the only one.

00:41:45.318 --> 00:41:54.263
SAM: So other than chasing her, going for the next
Vestige on the list, the third option is wish her

00:41:54.263 --> 00:41:58.965
good luck and continue on with our mission
ignoring the fact that she exists.

00:41:58.965 --> 00:42:00.632
MARISHA: Maybe she'll die in the Ozmit Sea.

00:42:00.632 --> 00:42:02.968
TALIESIN: She won't.

00:42:02.968 --> 00:42:04.791
LIAM: How long's it been since we left Draconia?

00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:10.933
MATT: Five days?

00:42:10.933 --> 00:42:12.329
LAURA: Not five days?!

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:18.907
MATT: From your travel from Draconia, back to
Whitestone, to resting in Whitestone, heading from

00:42:18.907 --> 00:42:26.064
there to the southern city, then travelling from
there to Ank'Harel, then you've had--

00:42:26.064 --> 00:42:30.914
TALIESIN: A lot of that was instantaneous. We did
camp three or four days--

00:42:30.914 --> 00:42:34.916
MATT: Well no, yeah about four or five days
because you travelled then from Whitestone to

00:42:34.916 --> 00:42:40.981
south of Ank'Harel, then you wind walked to
Ank'Harel, but then camped outside of Ank'Harel,

00:42:40.981 --> 00:42:45.675
because the time you got there was night, then you
made it into the city, then you stayed for the

00:42:45.675 --> 00:42:50.295
evening, you slept again and the next night you
went ahead and went into the casino, then slept

00:42:50.295 --> 00:42:52.604
the night there, so yeah, it's been about five
days.

00:42:52.604 --> 00:42:58.750
MARISHA: Is it like a flying from east to west
thing where we gain back a day when we go back?

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.108
MATT: No.

00:43:00.108 --> 00:43:02.906
LAURA: But we don't have to fly, we just have to
teleport there.

00:43:02.906 --> 00:43:04.552
TALIESIN: So long as we teleport we're fine.

00:43:04.552 --> 00:43:12.008
LAURA: But we don't have a plan. We have five days
to figure out how to fucking kill a dragon. Oh Jesus.

00:43:12.008 --> 00:43:16.563
MARISHA: And we didn't get the Vestige we came
here for, so--

00:43:16.563 --> 00:43:18.302
TALIESIN: No we did not, in fact, it's worse.

00:43:18.302 --> 00:43:23.397
MATT: Well two weeks was the agreement, so you
have more than five. Nine.

00:43:23.397 --> 00:43:25.816
LIAM: You can do anything in nine days.

00:43:25.816 --> 00:43:28.776
TRAVIS: We don't even have to keep the agreement,
come on.

00:43:28.776 --> 00:43:33.236
LAURA: Potentially.

00:43:33.236 --> 00:43:39.247
TRAVIS: Just saying. We getting the gun un-fucked
or what?

00:43:39.247 --> 00:43:41.278
TALIESIN: Let's go downstairs and talk to her
employer.

00:43:41.278 --> 00:43:42.391
LAURA: Treev?

00:43:42.391 --> 00:43:44.881
MATT: Treev, yes. All right.

00:43:44.881 --> 00:43:47.047
TALIESIN: I'm going to leave the gun upstairs
still.

00:43:47.047 --> 00:43:52.026
MARISHA: Wait, what? Don't we need it to tap the
gun to--

00:43:52.026 --> 00:43:53.821
SAM: Well we got to find out who's going to
un-fuck it.

00:43:53.821 --> 00:43:56.120
LAURA: Is Treev downstairs?

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:03.143
MATT: All right, you head down into the tavern,
and at this time of day it's a little empty, a

00:44:03.143 --> 00:44:09.014
little sparse, maybe like, four patrons. Two in
discussions, one that's deep in the cups and one

00:44:09.014 --> 00:44:14.045
in the midst of going through paperwork and in the
far back you see Treev once again has his heavy

00:44:14.045 --> 00:44:17.802
spectacles on and is currently looking through
that same book he was before, doesn't seem to pay

00:44:17.802 --> 00:44:19.574
any mind to you until you approach him.

00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:21.242
LAURA: Treev?

00:44:21.242 --> 00:44:25.977
MATT: "Oh, aye, good to see you. What can I do for
you?"

00:44:25.977 --> 00:44:29.656
LAURA: We need to talk to you. It's rather
urgent.

00:44:29.656 --> 00:44:36.908
MATT: "Then talk to me." Puts his book away,
glasses on it, leans forward.

00:44:36.908 --> 00:44:47.158
TALIESIN: There's been a complication. The
mistress is-- she's been assassinated.

00:44:47.158 --> 00:44:53.337
MARISHA: We hadn't heard anything in these past
few days, we decided to pay her a call.

00:44:53.337 --> 00:45:02.300
MATT: He leans forward a little bit on the bar.
Vex, Vax and Keyleth. You notice that the hooded

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:05.702
figure, that originally delivered the note, is
back in the far corner, where it was and it seems

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:09.033
to have stepped a couple inches out of the shadows as
well, paying very close attention to this

00:45:09.033 --> 00:45:10.418
conversation.

00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:12.704
TALIESIN: Did we bring the note with us? Good.

00:45:12.704 --> 00:45:18.079
MATT: Goes, "So you are saying that the mistress
was assassinated?"

00:45:18.079 --> 00:45:19.689
TALIESIN: And the cloak stolen.

00:45:19.689 --> 00:45:21.488
MATT: "Cloak?"

00:45:21.488 --> 00:45:23.381
TALIESIN: The cloak she wore.

00:45:23.381 --> 00:45:27.036
MATT: "And you know this how?"

00:45:27.036 --> 00:45:28.757
LAURA: We found her body.

00:45:28.757 --> 00:45:31.681
MATT: "Where?"

00:45:31.681 --> 00:45:33.155
LAURA: In her home.

00:45:33.155 --> 00:45:34.816
SCANLAN: Don't think that was her home.

00:45:34.816 --> 00:45:36.252
MARISHA: In her hideout.

00:45:36.252 --> 00:45:39.317
TALIESIN: In her room beneath the house.

00:45:39.317 --> 00:45:41.583
MATT: "How do you know where she lived?"

00:45:41.583 --> 00:45:51.972
TALIESIN: We are very clever. But not clever
enough to stop this. This appears to have happened

00:45:51.972 --> 00:45:56.191
possibly before we even-- we don't know when it
happened. It happened a while ago.

00:45:56.191 --> 00:45:58.107
LAURA: About a week ago. I think.

00:45:58.107 --> 00:46:00.413
MATT: Percy, make a persuasion check.

00:46:00.413 --> 00:46:10.789
TALIESIN: 13.

00:46:10.789 --> 00:46:19.499
MATT: Okay. Treev puts one hand out on the bar,
he's got a big heavy coin in it, he's nervously

00:46:19.499 --> 00:46:22.618
tapping it. (few knocks on wood)

00:46:22.618 --> 00:46:26.222
TALIESIN: We think we know who did it. In fact, we
are near positive we know who did it.

00:46:26.222 --> 00:46:31.105
MATT: You hear (door closing) as the door of the
tavern closes and all the patrons you saw are now

00:46:31.105 --> 00:46:36.924
standing up completely sober and they're all
taking a circle to the outside of your group. He's

00:46:36.924 --> 00:46:45.920
leaning forward, going, "All right, so you're
clever. You came looking for the mistress, she

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.525
"suddenly winds up dead. You found her body."

00:46:48.525 --> 00:46:51.463
TALIESIN: And we tell you this as opposed to
leaving.

00:46:51.463 --> 00:46:53.595
LAURA: We had nothing to do with it. We could've
left town.

00:46:53.595 --> 00:46:57.192
MARISHA: Clearly we know how this looks, which is
why we came to you first.

00:46:57.192 --> 00:46:59.361
TALIESIN: We are desperate in finding who did
this.

00:46:59.361 --> 00:47:01.257
LIAM: What's the hooded figure doing right now?

00:47:01.257 --> 00:47:07.577
MATT: Still sitting in the back of that shadowed
alcove between a bunch of barrels that are stacked

00:47:07.577 --> 00:47:09.170
and part of the bar side.

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:10.718
LIAM: I'm going to keep focused there.

00:47:10.718 --> 00:47:11.918
TRAVIS: Is he still tapping the coin?

00:47:11.918 --> 00:47:13.172
MATT: No, the coin tapping has stopped.

00:47:13.172 --> 00:47:17.991
MARISHA: And what are the people around us doing?
Are they, like, drawing their weapons?

00:47:17.991 --> 00:47:18.901
MATT: No.

00:47:18.901 --> 00:47:20.102
MARISHA: Do they seem armed?

00:47:20.102 --> 00:47:22.675
MATT: Do you take a look around?

00:47:22.675 --> 00:47:24.144
MARISHA: I want to just glance.

00:47:24.144 --> 00:47:27.282
TRAVIS: I take a very blatant look around.

00:47:27.282 --> 00:47:35.606
MATT: Okay. None of them appear to be armed, but
they're all looking very closely upon you. You can

00:47:35.606 --> 00:47:37.688
make a perception check, Keyleth and Grog, if
you'd like.

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:42.167
TRAVIS: 13.

00:47:42.167 --> 00:47:43.609
MARISHA: Not bad.

00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:45.167
TRAVIS: There is a ceiling.

00:47:45.167 --> 00:47:48.060
MARISHA: Straight perception? 25.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.036
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you see them staring. They look
pretty normal.

00:47:51.036 --> 00:47:53.002
TRAVIS: They look pretty.

00:47:53.002 --> 00:47:58.803
MATT: You do notice, what you didn't quite notice
before, when you first entered, but a lot of these

00:47:58.803 --> 00:48:04.507
tables have like small cubbies on the edges, and
each one of them are standing very close to one.

00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:10.712
One you see a little bit of a pommel that is
barely poking out and they're all at the

00:48:10.712 --> 00:48:17.669
ready. This tavern definitely is-- Mercenary band
uses this tavern as their base of operation and has

00:48:17.669 --> 00:48:23.418
definitely seemingly outfitted it to be functionally
good place for mercenaries when they need to be.

00:48:23.418 --> 00:48:28.770
MARISHA: I look down in front of me. Is there any
hidden cubbies in the table that we are at?

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.543
MATT: That you are at?

00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:31.606
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:48:31.606 --> 00:48:35.341
MATT: You have to get down to really inspect. You
want to do that?

00:48:35.341 --> 00:48:36.348
MARISHA: No.

00:48:36.348 --> 00:48:40.754
MATT: Okay. At initial glance you don't see
anything, because everything is close to you, it's

00:48:40.754 --> 00:48:45.133
from a top-down perspective and you're blocked from
seeing anything beneath.

00:48:45.133 --> 00:48:53.013
TALIESIN: For what it's worth, we will not draw
first. We want to find her. Have any of your

00:48:53.013 --> 00:49:00.414
people seen a woman with one metal arm? She's so
dangerous and now so much more dangerous.

00:49:00.414 --> 00:49:12.399
MATT: He goes ahead and puts his finger up this
way and marks this direction. The figure that

00:49:12.399 --> 00:49:19.988
you're watching, Vax, steps out from the shadow and
walks very calmly across the room, through all of

00:49:19.988 --> 00:49:26.812
you right to the edge of the bar by the door and
goes-- not breaking eye contact with you, speaks

00:49:26.812 --> 00:49:35.575
out of the side of his mouth, Treev goes, "Go
ahead and check their story. See her abode. We're

00:49:35.575 --> 00:49:40.016
"all going to wait here nice and patiently together
until we figure out what the fuck is going on."

00:49:40.016 --> 00:49:44.397
TRAVIS: Makes sense. Do you have any mead?

00:49:44.397 --> 00:49:46.091
MATT: "We got mead."

00:49:46.091 --> 00:49:52.659
TALIESIN: In the meantime, I'd like to at least to
start to tell you what we need next, for when our

00:49:52.659 --> 00:49:54.050
story is confirmed.

00:49:54.050 --> 00:49:58.799
MATT: "Well, you've certainly got a captive audience,
so go ahead."

00:49:58.799 --> 00:50:08.547
TALIESIN: This woman has been tracking us. She
placed a mystical tracker upon us at some point.

00:50:08.547 --> 00:50:17.733
We've just discovered it and we need to find a way
to move it away and put it somewhere she does not

00:50:17.733 --> 00:50:25.437
suspect that we know that she placed it and does
not see us coming when it's time for us to kill her.

00:50:25.437 --> 00:50:30.688
MATT: "So you're saying this woman that you're
chasing is the one that killed the mistress?"

00:50:30.688 --> 00:50:33.051
TALIESIN: Yes. We believe so.

00:50:33.051 --> 00:50:40.804
LAURA: Your mistress has-- had a very powerful item on
her. It's why we sought her out as well.

00:50:40.804 --> 00:50:44.975
MATT: "More so blinded-sided at the idea that the
mistress was felled by someone. She could take

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:47.137
"care of herself and has for quite some time."

00:50:47.137 --> 00:50:51.514
LAURA: From what I could see, her attackers were
not alone. There were five of them.

00:50:51.514 --> 00:50:53.552
LIAM: They had an unfair advantage.

00:50:53.552 --> 00:50:59.928
MATT: "Five of them and a woman, you say?" His
eyes narrow for a second. "Describe this woman."

00:50:59.928 --> 00:51:09.021
SAM: She disguises her appearance, so how we know
her might not be how you have seen her. She has

00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:12.513
sometimes shown herself as an old woman.

00:51:12.513 --> 00:51:20.136
MATT: "Old woman?" And he starts describing. "Sort
of a spindly gray-blonde hair, tumbles past the

00:51:20.136 --> 00:51:24.225
"shoulders, piercing blue-ish green eyes."

00:51:24.225 --> 00:51:25.928
TALIESIN: &lt;i&gt;Always&lt;/i&gt; piercing eyes.

00:51:25.928 --> 00:51:28.212
SAM: Did she come through here?

00:51:28.212 --> 00:51:32.062
MATT: "She was the last one to hire the mistress.
About a week before you came."

00:51:32.062 --> 00:51:33.173
TALIESIN: (sighs heavily)

00:51:33.173 --> 00:51:34.419
SAM: What was the job?

00:51:34.419 --> 00:51:35.597
MATT: "I don't know."

00:51:35.597 --> 00:51:38.723
SAM: And she had some fellows traveling with her?

00:51:38.723 --> 00:51:42.759
MATT: "She had five individuals following her,
aye."

00:51:42.759 --> 00:51:44.245
MARISHA: What did they look like?

00:51:44.245 --> 00:51:48.307
MATT: "Didn't get the best good look. Kept it very
hush-hush between me and the lady at the table.

00:51:48.307 --> 00:51:51.628
"Rest of them stayed at the back of the bar. Then
they went on their business."

00:51:51.628 --> 00:51:53.215
SAM: Where were they staying?

00:51:53.215 --> 00:51:54.180
MATT: "Here."

00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:55.467
SAM: In our rooms?

00:51:55.467 --> 00:51:56.995
MATT: "Aye."

00:51:56.995 --> 00:52:00.607
SAM: That gives me the heebie-jeebies.

00:52:00.607 --> 00:52:05.389
TALIESIN: That does not make me feel good. She is
so dangerous.

00:52:05.389 --> 00:52:07.634
MARISHA: How was she a full week ahead of us?

00:52:07.634 --> 00:52:10.223
LAURA: Oh shit. Treev--

00:52:10.223 --> 00:52:13.713
SAM: Because we went to Draconia.

00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:16.759
LAURA: I put Dust of Tracelessness on the ground.
In her home.

00:52:16.759 --> 00:52:18.851
MATT: "What's that mean?"

00:52:18.851 --> 00:52:24.834
TALIESIN: It's going to obfuscate any of the
scuffle. They're only going to find a body with

00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:26.206
holes in it.

00:52:26.206 --> 00:52:32.619
MATT: "So you're telling me that you came in here
with a story about a murder of one of my finest mercs."

00:52:32.619 --> 00:52:33.613
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:52:33.613 --> 00:52:39.323
MATT: "And you decided upon finding this murder to
get rid of all the evidence of said murder and

00:52:39.323 --> 00:52:41.925
"anything that could possibly point to you not
being the murderers."

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:48.222
TALIESIN: I did point this out to everybody before
we came down here, but at the moment we were a

00:52:48.222 --> 00:52:51.054
little bit thrown by the dead woman.

00:52:51.054 --> 00:52:52.882
MATT: "I'm not going to lie, I mean as far as--"

00:52:52.882 --> 00:52:57.753
LIAM: Why would we come directly to you if that
were the case? Why wouldn't we have not just left?

00:52:57.753 --> 00:52:59.482
LAURA: Plus, you know what?

00:52:59.482 --> 00:53:02.450
TALIESIN: They will be able to tell the body is at
least a week old.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:06.771
LAURA: Exactly. Your man has seen a dead body
before. He's going to be able to tell that it's

00:53:06.771 --> 00:53:08.101
been there for a while.

00:53:08.101 --> 00:53:11.432
MARISHA: I'm sure you have a cleric in the circle.
Talk to her firsthand if you have to.

00:53:11.432 --> 00:53:15.785
LIAM: I'm curious if you can imagine a reason why
we would come to you with this rather than sneak

00:53:15.785 --> 00:53:17.109
away in the night.

00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:19.333
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm just curious how much the mead
is?

00:53:19.333 --> 00:53:31.479
MATT: "On the house." He reaches under the bar and
pulls up one thick, dark, red ceramic bottle.

00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:35.559
Cap's already off. He's plucked it off with his
thumb and sets it in front of you.

00:53:35.559 --> 00:53:37.775
TRAVIS: My thanks.

00:53:37.775 --> 00:53:40.432
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

00:53:40.432 --> 00:53:52.209
MATT: "Guess it's possibly one of the major
setbacks of this line of business. Very few grow

00:53:52.209 --> 00:54:04.107
"too old and gray and get to die happy in their beds.
God knows I wasn't planning to." There's a long,

00:54:04.107 --> 00:54:12.014
awkward pause interspersed with bits of
conversation for about 15 minutes before the

00:54:12.014 --> 00:54:18.446
hooded figure returns, enters the door, comes over
and whispers for a good solid minute in the ear of

00:54:18.446 --> 00:54:29.804
Treev, before stepping back and calmly walking
back to its corner. Treev sits up. "Well, parts of

00:54:29.804 --> 00:54:36.775
"your story certainly hold up. The body has been
there for a while, at least from before I saw you.

00:54:36.775 --> 00:54:40.218
"Mind you, I don't know when you came into town. We
only met a few days ago."

00:54:40.218 --> 00:54:47.837
TALIESIN: If we were smart enough to take care of
her and smart enough to pull all of this off, this

00:54:47.837 --> 00:54:49.908
would be a ridiculous move.

00:54:49.908 --> 00:54:53.642
LAURA: (laughs) That we would come to hire her after
we had already--

00:54:53.642 --> 00:54:54.709
MARISHA: Killed her?

00:54:54.709 --> 00:54:56.345
TALIESIN: I would beg you to explain why we're
having this conversation.

00:54:56.345 --> 00:55:01.207
MATT: "Oh, believe me. A lot of &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; doesn't make
sense, period. So I'm just trying to figure it all

00:55:01.207 --> 00:55:06.690
"out." And he rubs the end of his long draconian
snout.

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:12.329
TALIESIN: The woman in question helped murder my
entire family, took great pleasure and delight in

00:55:12.329 --> 00:55:14.897
it. I have been tracking her for years.

00:55:14.897 --> 00:55:17.048
MATT: "What you plan to do when you find her,
then?"

00:55:17.048 --> 00:55:24.872
TALIESIN: Kill her. That's all. I've lost my taste
for anything beyond that, but she is dangerous and

00:55:24.872 --> 00:55:26.183
she is evil.

00:55:26.183 --> 00:55:29.177
LIAM: In this moment, everyone in this room wants
the same thing.

00:55:29.177 --> 00:55:37.577
MARISHA: We didn't come to you because we
necessarily needed to go through the proper

00:55:37.577 --> 00:55:42.641
channels, we did it because we were trying to be
forthcoming. Clearly you are all a talented bunch,

00:55:42.641 --> 00:55:44.615
so are we.

00:55:44.615 --> 00:55:49.894
TALIESIN: My feelings for her have become very
complex. I don't care who kills her at this point.

00:55:49.894 --> 00:55:52.055
She just needs to be removed from the earth.

00:55:52.055 --> 00:55:55.236
MATT: "Which one of you is your dealmaker?"

00:55:55.236 --> 00:55:59.794
LIAM: I boot Scanlan forward on the tush.

00:55:59.794 --> 00:56:01.740
SAM: Hello, hi.

00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.974
MATT: "This one?"

00:56:02.974 --> 00:56:06.459
SAM: I make the best deals, I know the best
words.

00:56:06.459 --> 00:56:11.770
MATT: "&lt;i&gt;This&lt;/i&gt; one?"

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:17.528
SAM: Sometimes it's Vex, but many times it's me.

00:56:17.528 --> 00:56:27.237
MATT: He leans over the bar and gets real close up
to you, and takes a moment to (sniffs). "Aye, you

00:56:27.237 --> 00:56:31.872
"smell like trouble. I like that." Make a
persuasion check.

00:56:31.872 --> 00:56:33.556
SAM: What am I persuading him to do?

00:56:33.556 --> 00:56:36.298
MATT: This is your essence of presence and telling
him that you're the kind of person that--

00:56:36.298 --> 00:56:37.619
SAM: Oh, my general charm?

00:56:37.619 --> 00:56:38.564
MATT: Your general charm.

00:56:38.564 --> 00:56:41.982
TALIESIN: I don't know what he's wearing, but it's
very nice.

00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:44.819
SAM: Persuasion, you say? 29.

00:56:44.819 --> 00:56:55.104
MATT: "How is this for a deal? I got a nice fine
look at your faces, I got friends all across these

00:56:55.104 --> 00:57:06.680
"lands. If what you say is true, you go. We let you
leave. You find this murdering bitch, you kill

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:15.429
"her. I want one thing, her good hand. I think that
would be vengeance enough for the mistress."

00:57:15.429 --> 00:57:18.024
MARISHA: I mean, we don't have any use for it.

00:57:18.024 --> 00:57:20.012
TALIESIN: I feel &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; good about that deal.

00:57:20.012 --> 00:57:21.341
LIAM: Good terms.

00:57:21.341 --> 00:57:24.378
MATT: "Not talking to you. I'm talking to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;."

00:57:24.378 --> 00:57:28.219
SAM: That's lovely, but we can't find her without
some assistance.

00:57:28.219 --> 00:57:33.472
MATT: "Well, you've come to the right place. What
assistance do I have to give you, what do you need?"

00:57:33.472 --> 00:57:37.923
SAM: We need to get this curse off of the thing
that found your assassin.

00:57:37.923 --> 00:57:41.607
MATT: "Can't really help you with that, sorry,
mate."

00:57:41.607 --> 00:57:44.404
SAM: Don't have any magic wielders among you?

00:57:44.404 --> 00:57:48.617
MATT: "We've got scattered mercs throughout the
city, aye, but they work for coin, and half of

00:57:48.617 --> 00:57:49.952
"them are busy in other jobs."

00:57:49.952 --> 00:57:51.178
LIAM: We have coin.

00:57:51.178 --> 00:57:54.275
MATT: "How much you got?"

00:57:54.275 --> 00:57:56.067
LIAM: What do we got?

00:57:56.067 --> 00:57:57.667
TRAVIS: Enough.

00:57:57.667 --> 00:58:04.349
TALIESIN: Let us know what it takes. Money is
money and we have a long way to go and a lot to

00:58:04.349 --> 00:58:07.146
deal with, but we are happy to pay for the work
that is done.

00:58:07.146 --> 00:58:09.532
MATT: "All right. I can call someone in."

00:58:09.532 --> 00:58:14.629
SAM: We also may need some naval assistance--

00:58:14.629 --> 00:58:17.249
LAURA: Specifically an airship of sorts--

00:58:17.249 --> 00:58:22.273
TALIESIN: Or transportation, she's heading, she's
on a boat, she's heading north to the island of--

00:58:22.304 --> 00:58:23.911
TRAVIS: Glintshore.

00:58:23.911 --> 00:58:28.611
MARISHA: Or, you know, even if you know of any
trees, big trees.

00:58:28.611 --> 00:58:37.219
MATT: He goes "Hmm. Ships, no, not much in the way
of ships here in the middle of a desert, you're

00:58:37.219 --> 00:58:41.686
"looking for them sky-buggers. Looking for a ship
like that for seafaring types you're going to want

00:58:41.686 --> 00:58:47.322
"to go past the Agrin Mountains, then make your way
towards the Bay of Gifts."

00:58:47.322 --> 00:58:48.954
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Bay of Gifts.

00:58:48.954 --> 00:58:50.920
MATT: "That's where you'll find the port town of
Shamal."

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:52.886
MARISHA: Port town of Shamal?

00:58:52.886 --> 00:59:00.502
MATT: "Shamal. The mountain range is vast in
itself, you're looking at, oh, at least a week on

00:59:00.502 --> 00:59:02.555
"foot to try and traverse those mountains."

00:59:02.555 --> 00:59:03.928
LIAM: Did you say Bay of Gifs?

00:59:03.928 --> 00:59:05.358
SAM: Bay of Jifs, it's pronounced.

00:59:05.358 --> 00:59:08.129
MATT: "I'm going to fucking fuck you."

00:59:08.129 --> 00:59:11.838
(laughter)

00:59:11.838 --> 00:59:15.438
TALIESIN: It's a local joke, I'm so sorry.

00:59:15.438 --> 00:59:20.643
MARISHA: The port of Shamal?

00:59:20.643 --> 00:59:23.637
SAM: There is a skyport near here, is that true?

00:59:23.637 --> 00:59:26.113
MATT: "Aye, it's over by the--"

00:59:26.113 --> 00:59:28.891
SAM: Controlled by the local government?

00:59:28.891 --> 00:59:32.732
MATT: "There's no one fucking controls the
skyport."

00:59:32.732 --> 00:59:35.514
TALIESIN: We're not asking you, we have other
friends as well.

00:59:35.514 --> 00:59:41.043
MATT: "Well, if you're looking for speed, it's
probably your best bet. Ships on this ocean, let's

00:59:41.043 --> 00:59:44.296
"say the weather's not usually handy."

00:59:44.296 --> 00:59:47.758
TALIESIN: We are looking for speed, and a crazy
captain.

00:59:47.758 --> 00:59:51.552
MATT: "Well, wish you the best of luck."

00:59:51.552 --> 00:59:52.716
LAURA: Thank you.

00:59:52.716 --> 01:00:00.233
MATT: "Now, go! Kill her. Give me her hand. I
figure if time goes by and I haven't heard from

01:00:00.233 --> 01:00:04.017
"you, you've either died or I'll be sending some of
our mercs to come find you."

01:00:04.017 --> 01:00:07.001
LIAM: Yeah, but the magic thing with the gun.

01:00:07.001 --> 01:00:11.148
SAM: How long would it take to get this person who
can remove a curse?

01:00:11.148 --> 01:00:13.981
TALIESIN: Or if you were going to go do something
like this, who would you find in town?

01:00:13.981 --> 01:00:18.292
MATT: "If you're looking for fast, speedy, and
immediate assistance with this, well, that's going

01:00:18.292 --> 01:00:23.903
"to have to run the cost up a bit, see. We have
quite an enchanter that could probably help you

01:00:23.903 --> 01:00:24.803
"with that."

01:00:24.803 --> 01:00:25.757
LAURA: Oh really?

01:00:25.757 --> 01:00:34.776
MATT: "Aye. See if in the next hour I could bring
him in, but it'll run you, full disillusion or

01:00:34.776 --> 01:00:38.726
"whatever you need, 750 gold."

01:00:38.726 --> 01:00:41.553
TALIESIN: Not full disillusion, how about a
transference?

01:00:41.553 --> 01:00:43.464
MATT: "Transference--"

01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:45.320
TALIESIN: To move the enchantment to another
object.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.771
MATT: "Well, takes--"

01:00:46.771 --> 01:00:50.037
LAURA: It's a much easier enchantment.

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:55.038
MATT: "Moving something takes a little bit longer
than to just get rid of something."

01:00:55.038 --> 01:00:56.317
TALIESIN: How much longer?

01:00:56.317 --> 01:01:01.318
MATT: "I dunno, not one of them types. But I mean,
we've had a couple of enchantments moved in the

01:01:01.318 --> 01:01:04.655
"past, and that was anywhere from a few days to a
few weeks, get that done."

01:01:04.655 --> 01:01:07.229
MARISHA: Why don't we call them in and have them
look at it?

01:01:07.229 --> 01:01:08.501
MATT: "All right."

01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:09.607
SAM: 750? Do we have that to spare?

01:01:09.607 --> 01:01:10.454
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:01:10.454 --> 01:01:11.879
TALIESIN: That's worth its weight.

01:01:11.879 --> 01:01:14.353
MATT: "750."

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:18.457
LAURA: 750, or if you have a need of gems, we have
gems.

01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:22.875
LIAM: You don't get fast and cheap.

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:23.955
TALIESIN: I know.

01:01:23.955 --> 01:01:25.252
SAM: Are you a gem lover?

01:01:25.252 --> 01:01:30.253
MATT: "I carry a bit of jewelry on occasion."

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.555
SAM: I like you. What do we have?

01:01:32.555 --> 01:01:36.508
LAURA: So many things. You should call your
enchanter.

01:01:36.508 --> 01:01:44.973
MATT: "All right," and he goes ahead and pulls out
a small tome of blank sheets, many you see have

01:01:44.973 --> 01:01:49.773
been torn out, and he makes a quick note on one,
rolls it up very simply, doesn't do the usual

01:01:49.845 --> 01:01:58.523
rigmarole of an official writ, but hands it to the
masked hooded figure in the corner who walks out

01:01:58.523 --> 01:02:02.980
and darts off. "Kyme'll be here in a hour."

01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.015
LAURA: An hour.

01:02:04.015 --> 01:02:04.893
SAM: Kine?

01:02:04.893 --> 01:02:05.782
MATT: "Kyme."

01:02:05.782 --> 01:02:07.129
LAURA: Kynan?

01:02:07.129 --> 01:02:10.549
LIAM: Sorry, that rang a bell. Sorry.

01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:13.871
MATT: "Payment?"

01:02:13.871 --> 01:02:17.325
LAURA: Payment?

01:02:17.325 --> 01:02:18.743
SAM: Up front? Wow.

01:02:18.743 --> 01:02:21.114
LAURA: But we don't even know what he's doing
yet.

01:02:21.114 --> 01:02:23.604
MATT: "Do you trust in my service?"

01:02:23.604 --> 01:02:28.842
LAURA: Of course, I don't know what we're going to
have him do, that's all.

01:02:28.842 --> 01:02:32.248
MATT: "Well if you'd much rather, we could go
ahead and clean out your guts here in the floor,

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:35.177
"wouldn't be the first time I had to swab the
floors here."

01:02:35.177 --> 01:02:44.046
LAURA: How about these two beautiful sapphires?
They're quite lovely.

01:02:44.046 --> 01:02:45.878
MATT: "All right."

01:02:45.878 --> 01:02:50.863
LAURA: And-- and I pull out a giant raw ruby as
well.

01:02:50.863 --> 01:02:58.837
MATT: He knocks the countertop and gestures for
you to put them down. He looks over at one of the

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:04.649
guys in the bar. They've all relaxed a bit now,
two of them have sat down. One of them approaches;

01:03:04.649 --> 01:03:14.649
human, a little scruffy, looks like he's a little
ill to be honest, like he's probably not had a

01:03:14.649 --> 01:03:21.121
good week of food. He, however, walks up and
fumbles through a small pouch and pulls out a

01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:30.436
small jeweler's eyepiece and takes them up and
inspects each of them independently. How much are

01:03:30.436 --> 01:03:31.894
they worth?

01:03:31.894 --> 01:03:36.572
LAURA: 200 each for the sapphires, and the ruby is
150.

01:03:36.572 --> 01:03:38.169
SAM: Jesus, Laura.

01:03:38.169 --> 01:03:40.553
LAURA: It's only a hundred gold short!

01:03:40.553 --> 01:03:53.318
MATT: "I'd take it." Sits back down. "Very well,
debt is paid." Takes the gems, pops them in his

01:03:53.318 --> 01:03:57.635
little side pouch. Do you guys wait for the hour?

01:03:57.635 --> 01:04:03.887
TALIESIN: I was going to say, if somebody wants to
go booking passage on an airship, my personal

01:04:03.887 --> 01:04:07.559
feeling is that Grog and Scanlan would be the
people to send on such an adventure.

01:04:07.559 --> 01:04:13.528
SAM: Grog? I mean, yes, Grog would be good at
that, yes, let's do that.

01:04:13.528 --> 01:04:16.514
TALIESIN: I'm only saying Grog because then they
know what they're getting into.

01:04:16.514 --> 01:04:18.073
SAM: I like that idea.

01:04:18.073 --> 01:04:19.992
TRAVIS: Are you trying to get me out of the room?

01:04:19.992 --> 01:04:26.048
TALIESIN: No! Well, yes. Would you rather sit for
an hour in here or would you rather go outside and

01:04:26.048 --> 01:04:28.080
talk to somebody about a giant flying boat?

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:29.939
TRAVIS: The last one.

01:04:29.939 --> 01:04:34.905
LIAM: Perfect, it's like Hannibal and Mr. T,
together, that's what you want.

01:04:34.905 --> 01:04:38.168
TALIESIN: I don't know, that's my opinion,
personally, unless anybody else--

01:04:38.168 --> 01:04:40.045
TRAVIS: Just call me Baracus, let's go.

01:04:40.045 --> 01:04:42.543
SAM: All right, we'll go.

01:04:42.543 --> 01:04:45.445
TALIESIN: Our friends are going to arrange travel
for us, the rest of us are going to stay here, is

01:04:45.445 --> 01:04:46.830
that appropriate?

01:04:46.830 --> 01:04:55.137
MATT: "Certainly. Sit, I'll get you some food." So
is it going to be just you two?

01:04:55.137 --> 01:04:57.691
SAM: I guess we're going to go try to find an
airship.

01:04:57.789 --> 01:05:02.067
TRAVIS: Yeah, Twins! Schwarzenegger and DeVito, at
it again!

01:05:02.067 --> 01:05:04.391
(laughter)

01:05:04.391 --> 01:05:05.642
TALIESIN: Julius, my god!

01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:07.310
SAM: Which one's which?

01:05:07.310 --> 01:05:10.644
LIAM: Vincent, you are my twin.

01:05:10.644 --> 01:05:17.165
TALIESIN: I'm pregnant, Vincent. Oh, wrong one,
sorry. I always thought it was the same guy. In my

01:05:17.165 --> 01:05:18.648
head. It's a sequel.

01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:25.591
MATT: All right, so, as the rest of you guys stay
behind you get a fair meal, the two of you begin

01:05:25.591 --> 01:05:36.740
making your way through Ank'Harel. You're making
your way over towards the edge of the Suncut

01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:42.662
Bazaar towards the Sand Herald district right on
that cusp there is where you saw the skyport in

01:05:42.662 --> 01:05:47.335
the distance. Go ahead and make an investigation
check. You can make one as well, Grog.

01:05:47.335 --> 01:05:49.316
SAM: 25.

01:05:49.316 --> 01:05:53.078
TRAVIS: 17!

01:05:53.078 --> 01:05:57.307
MATT: All right. Where normally it would be
confusing to find where the base of it is as it is

01:05:57.307 --> 01:06:03.083
obfuscated by a series of other larger buildings,
you guys ask a couple of folks rather quickly that

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:08.780
know the layout of the town really well, and with
enough of a flash of a smile and a flash of a

01:06:08.780 --> 01:06:18.437
really intense arm muscle, within the next 30
minutes or so find yourself at the base of the

01:06:18.437 --> 01:06:20.676
actual skyport. It is called the Indala Skyport.

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.608
SAM: (sings) Indala.

01:06:22.608 --> 01:06:31.486
MATT: Not as tall as the one in Emon which lays on
the outskirts of the Cloudtop District, but it

01:06:31.486 --> 01:06:39.677
appears to be on the level, it's maybe a good
five stories up. The outside of it is a similar

01:06:39.677 --> 01:06:44.260
chain lifted platform as the tower at the Cerulean
Palace that you guys traversed earlier in your

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:50.366
time in Ank'Harel. There is a large stone scaffold
with no walls, sitting there on the ground. As you

01:06:50.366 --> 01:06:56.007
approach, there are two people dressed in simple
clothing, you see some dust and dirt on their

01:06:56.007 --> 01:07:00.427
hands, they're in the midst of moving crates up
and down and you see they're moving some barrels

01:07:00.427 --> 01:07:06.313
off of the platform, putting them up onto a cart
that's probably going to be wheeled deeper into

01:07:06.313 --> 01:07:16.201
the city. As you approach the platform you see one
of them is by a bell mechanism, attached to part

01:07:16.201 --> 01:07:21.721
of the platform, a small block that's about
shoulder high, and there's a bell on the end of it

01:07:21.721 --> 01:07:23.071
with a ringer.

01:07:23.071 --> 01:07:29.274
TRAVIS: Wait, before we ring Indala: have you ever
rented a skyship before?

01:07:29.274 --> 01:07:31.002
SAM: No, I have no idea what we're doing here.

01:07:31.002 --> 01:07:32.201
TRAVIS: Oh really?

01:07:32.201 --> 01:07:38.811
SAM: I mean, I assume we're trying to find out how
much it costs for a seven day rental including a

01:07:38.811 --> 01:07:40.103
pilot or two?

01:07:40.103 --> 01:07:41.923
TRAVIS: So we're doing this like the straight and
narrow way.

01:07:41.923 --> 01:07:44.110
SAM: We're getting the information, probably come
back and steal it.

01:07:44.110 --> 01:07:47.624
TRAVIS: Ooh, okay, I'll be quiet, you talk.

01:07:47.624 --> 01:07:50.642
SAM: Okay, well, you're pretty good at this too.

01:07:50.642 --> 01:07:55.083
TRAVIS: Yeah, well. (singing) Indala, Indala

01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:57.005
LIAM: Help, help, it's happening.

01:07:57.005 --> 01:07:58.582
TALIESIN: Help, help, it's actually happening.

01:07:58.582 --> 01:08:00.117
TRAVIS: Do you mind if I ring the bell?

01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:02.927
SAM: Yeah, go for it.

01:08:02.927 --> 01:08:06.306
TRAVIS: Can I ring the fucking shit out of that
bell?

01:08:06.306 --> 01:08:10.298
MATT: As you step up onto the stone platform both
of you, the two guys that are working, the guy

01:08:10.298 --> 01:08:14.451
keeps putting the barrels, there's like two or
three on the side there, and he goes ahead and

01:08:14.451 --> 01:08:21.809
sets one of the three up, staring at you as you
approach. The other guy is to the side, goes, "Can

01:08:21.809 --> 01:08:27.430
"I help you?" As you walk past and turn back and
smile and (bell ringing) start ringing the crap

01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:32.245
out of it. Make a strength check.

01:08:32.245 --> 01:08:38.288
TRAVIS: Aww no, oh that's not too bad. 13.

01:08:38.288 --> 01:08:45.791
MATT: 13, okay. You have enough control over your
physical brawn as to not snap or destroy the bell,

01:08:45.791 --> 01:08:51.125
however, what happens is after you ring the bell
for a few seconds, the guy goes, "Wait, no!" And

01:08:51.125 --> 01:08:58.585
before anything else happens, the chains that were
slack tighten up, and the platform begins to lift

01:08:58.585 --> 01:09:04.305
up. The guy who had two barrels left on the
platform still is like "No, wait!" And goes over

01:09:04.305 --> 01:09:07.927
and tries to grab one of the barrels as it tumbles
off and breaks on the ground next to him.

01:09:07.927 --> 01:09:12.622
(yelling in Marquesian) and is raising his fists.

01:09:12.622 --> 01:09:15.236
SAM: We're on an elevator?

01:09:15.236 --> 01:09:20.510
MATT: Yeah, and it's now lifting up and it's about
15-20 feet off the ground and it's going up to the

01:09:20.510 --> 01:09:25.990
top. The bell seemed to have notified whatever
crew is bringing the platform up, but he didn't

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:29.116
get a chance to finish bringing his load off the
platform before you rung the bell.

01:09:29.116 --> 01:09:30.314
TRAVIS: I think we're doing it right.

01:09:30.314 --> 01:09:31.391
SAM: I think so.

01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:37.482
MATT: As you leave the two gentlemen below, as the
two of you lift up on this platform, you make your

01:09:37.482 --> 01:09:45.615
way up to the elevated terrace that marks the
actual skyport and it's a large, wide, thick

01:09:45.615 --> 01:09:50.679
platform that's built atop a series of warehouses
that fill out this district, and this was a newer

01:09:50.679 --> 01:09:58.189
addition to it as this technology became
available. Go ahead and roll a history check.

01:09:58.189 --> 01:10:00.589
SAM: Natural 20.

01:10:00.589 --> 01:10:05.397
TRAVIS: Wow!

01:10:05.397 --> 01:10:06.812
SAM: Love me some airships.

01:10:06.812 --> 01:10:12.708
MATT: Actually, skyships originated in Ank'Harel.
This is where the crystals that hold them aloft

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:19.769
are enchanted. There have been other ships. There
are different designs that are constructed in

01:10:19.769 --> 01:10:26.511
different towns. You do know that there is no
skyship transport to Wildemount, and that was part

01:10:26.511 --> 01:10:35.438
of the reason why the Sovereign Uriel was trying
to make that deal with the Briarwoods under the

01:10:35.438 --> 01:10:42.716
idea that it would open trade with Wildemount.
It's pretty insular, locked off from the larger

01:10:42.716 --> 01:10:46.779
countries here that work together. The skyport
here is probably the first skyport that was built

01:10:46.779 --> 01:10:54.092
and this is the origin of that tech. As you come
to the very top of the platform,

01:10:54.092 --> 01:11:01.372
it eventually stops and you see one
gentleman there who's essentially working this

01:11:01.372 --> 01:11:05.010
large crank that brings the platform up and it has
a series of thick chains that wind on themselves.

01:11:05.010 --> 01:11:10.017
As soon as he finishes and you guys get to the top
he turns. "What, yes, what. Hello?"

01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:11.343
TRAVIS: Meep-meep!

01:11:11.343 --> 01:11:21.229
SAM: Be pleased. We are here to inquire about some
business if you don't mind.

01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:25.540
MATT: He points that way, and you guys look right,
and the rest of this terrace for the record--

01:11:25.540 --> 01:11:35.273
there are two skyships that are currently docked
here at the moment. One that has a very nice,

01:11:35.273 --> 01:11:43.299
thick, heavy design, it has beautiful gems
encrusted in the side and there's brass and gold

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:48.641
inlay that twists into this turquoise transition
to the bottom. It's a beautiful ship. You can see

01:11:48.641 --> 01:11:54.914
there's a crew of about 12, that are currently
loading things onto it right now. There's a big,

01:11:54.914 --> 01:11:57.762
crane-like apparatus similar to what you had in
Emon that is currently putting things onto the

01:11:57.762 --> 01:12:01.817
ship. It looks like it's being heavily loaded for
transport somewhere. There's another ship, it

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:07.717
looks familiar, it's actually very similar to the
Emon designs that you guys saw at the skyports

01:12:07.717 --> 01:12:14.878
over there that appears to be, by about six heavy 
chains, locked to the opposite side of this skyport and doesn't

01:12:14.926 --> 01:12:20.378
seem to have any apparent hustle bustle of crew
around. It's a little bit smaller than the more

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:26.329
intricate design. The one that has all the work
around it does match some of the design aesthetic

01:12:26.329 --> 01:12:30.680
of some of the higher end areas of Ank'Harel, so
that you probably imagine it was one of the

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:35.771
original skyships that was built here. The other
one you saw has the small fins on the side,

01:12:35.771 --> 01:12:40.705
similar to the one you rode across to Vasselheim.
You do also notice that there are about six Hands

01:12:40.705 --> 01:12:45.985
of Ord scattered across the terrace in full armor
that are basically keeping an eye out and watching

01:12:45.985 --> 01:12:56.796
everything, making sure that no bullshit goes
down. You do see a small building that's in the

01:12:56.796 --> 01:13:04.027
center of this terrace, that maybe has about three
or four different rooms. Apparently, the

01:13:04.027 --> 01:13:11.465
individual who was overseeing this entire process
with the one big ship is walking back and forth

01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:14.431
between with instructions to the foreman who's
yelling out to the crewmen who are loading up this

01:13:14.431 --> 01:13:16.529
big ship. That'll probably be the place to go to
inquire.

01:13:16.529 --> 01:13:17.973
SAM: Okay. We go over there.

01:13:17.973 --> 01:13:22.135
MATT: All right. As you walk in--

01:13:22.135 --> 01:13:23.506
SAM: We die.

01:13:23.506 --> 01:13:28.382
MATT: Suffer a horrible stroke and fall to the
ground. Scanlan is no more.

01:13:28.382 --> 01:13:30.782
TRAVIS: Green dragon unveils herself and we die.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:33.550
LIAM: My barrels! (dragon roaring noise)

01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:39.405
TRAVIS: Shit, literally in the last place we would have
looked.

01:13:39.405 --> 01:13:58.072
MATT: So as you walk into the room, it's fairly
quiet. There appears to be a clerk office there

01:13:58.072 --> 01:14:04.723
with a bunch of ledgers stacked up, and you can
see a layout of a number of days with notes

01:14:04.723 --> 01:14:11.980
scrawled in a language that you don't recognize.
There are a couple of small clockwork timepieces

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.494
that are against the walls there. And you see a
younger woman, probably mid-20s, but going gray a

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:21.965
little early all on one side of her head, who is
currently going through one of these books. She

01:14:21.965 --> 01:14:29.597
has a quill between her teeth right now, she's
thumbing through the pages. Looks up, "Can I help

01:14:29.597 --> 01:14:32.226
"you?" Takes the quill out, sets it down.

01:14:32.226 --> 01:14:39.579
SAM: Hello, Be pleased, beep beep. My associate
and I would like to inquire about renting an

01:14:39.637 --> 01:14:41.041
airship.

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.250
MATT: "Renting an airship."

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:46.028
SAM: Chartering it for a trip.

01:14:46.028 --> 01:14:56.408
MATT: "Okay, well for now, let's see. Ship Vusin
is already chartered and is loading up to be

01:14:56.408 --> 01:15:04.791
"heading northward towards Issylra. That is not
available. The other one which is the Deera has

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:10.903
"been docked for about four weeks without use. So
you could go inquire with the captain there."

01:15:10.903 --> 01:15:15.548
SAM: Is that the crappier one or the better one?

01:15:15.548 --> 01:15:16.839
MATT It's the smaller one.

01:15:16.839 --> 01:15:22.145
SAM: Okay, so we would charter from the captain
themself, not from you?

01:15:22.145 --> 01:15:33.566
MATT: "Well the captain would pay us a cut based
on what the destination is."

01:15:33.566 --> 01:15:36.801
SAM: So I can do my homework, how much do you
think a week's charter would run on an airship?

01:15:36.801 --> 01:15:38.551
MATT: "That is for you to negotiate with the
captain."

01:15:38.551 --> 01:15:41.215
TRAVIS: Yes, is there any way to book passage on
the ship that's already moving northward?

01:15:41.215 --> 01:15:43.355
SAM: As passengers.

01:15:43.355 --> 01:15:48.563
MATT: "That is not a passenger-based ship,
unfortunately that is actually working for one of

01:15:48.563 --> 01:15:52.606
"the guilds. It is paid for use of their mercantile
only."

01:15:52.606 --> 01:15:55.376
SAM: Okay.

01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:58.746
TRAVIS: How fast is that smaller ship?

01:15:58.746 --> 01:16:05.949
MATT: "Unloaded, pretty quick. The cargo can load
down ships."

01:16:05.949 --> 01:16:07.405
TRAVIS: Hmm, yes.

01:16:07.405 --> 01:16:10.673
MATT: "Depends on how fast you wish to go and
where you are going. May I ask where you are

01:16:10.673 --> 01:16:11.915
"planning to charter this to?"

01:16:11.915 --> 01:16:15.891
SAM: Our mission is a bit of a hush-hush one, we
better not disclose that.

01:16:15.891 --> 01:16:26.079
TRAVIS: Yeah, we are going to an ocean.

01:16:26.079 --> 01:16:29.974
MATT: "Perhaps it is best that we negotiate the
price here than as opposed to with the captain."

01:16:29.974 --> 01:16:34.095
SAM: Yes, that would be preferable for sure.

01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:37.572
TRAVIS: Wait, why? Who's the captain?

01:16:37.572 --> 01:16:45.401
MATT: She stands up and walks over to one of the
small windows that leads out to the terrace and

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:51.763
you can see another bell that's out there and she
grabs the edge (bell ringing) on the bell, goes

01:16:51.763 --> 01:16:59.965
back to her seat. "I'm calling the captain, he'll
be here." A few minutes pass, in the distance out

01:16:59.965 --> 01:17:11.269
the window you can see a small rope ladder drops,
and a figure makes their way over and walks in.

01:17:11.269 --> 01:17:18.960
Inside, in gold-trimmed armor is a familiar sight,
this is Captain Damon, the guy who actually

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.950
brought you guys across the Ozmit Sea.

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:24.566
SAM: It's our guy! Damon!

01:17:24.566 --> 01:17:28.877
MARISHA: Are there not that many pilots in the
world?

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:41.036
MATT: There aren't a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of skyships. You would
know, there's probably six in commission.

01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:43.676
SAM: How fast did this one make the Kessel Run?

01:17:43.676 --> 01:17:49.882
MATT: It was a week across the entire Ozmit Sea,
that was with some cargo on board, so it wasn't

01:17:49.882 --> 01:17:55.609
very slow. It would have taken a normal ship two
and a half weeks.

01:17:55.609 --> 01:17:57.202
SAM: Does Damon recognize us?

01:17:57.202 --> 01:18:00.499
MATT: As he walks in he goes "Yes, are we ready
to--"

01:18:00.499 --> 01:18:03.753
MARISHA: Wyverns attacked us!

01:18:03.753 --> 01:18:04.969
LIAM: (whispering) We're not there.

01:18:04.969 --> 01:18:07.016
MARISHA: I'm not there at all!

01:18:07.016 --> 01:18:12.362
TRAVIS: What did you end up drinking in that damn
tavern?

01:18:12.362 --> 01:18:16.446
SAM: Captain Damon! Hello.

01:18:16.446 --> 01:18:17.648
MATT: "Wait, I know you."

01:18:17.648 --> 01:18:20.891
SAM: Yes, we've flown together before. On the
friendly skies.

01:18:20.891 --> 01:18:24.890
MATT: "Yes, that was a dangerous journey."

01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:32.143
SAM: It was, and would have been more dangerous
had we not been there. To protect you and your ship.

01:18:32.143 --> 01:18:37.294
MATT: "Indeed. We appreciate that. What can I do
for you?" And he looks over towards the clerk who

01:18:37.294 --> 01:18:41.121
goes, "They are looking to charter a ship
northward. I know nothing else more, but I figured

01:18:41.121 --> 01:18:45.877
"the confusion here would allow us at least both to
discuss this so we can negotiate the proper

01:18:45.877 --> 01:18:50.726
"price. So you talk, I'll be here to keep record."
And she opens a fresh page in her tome, dips her quill--

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.632
TRAVIS: Mmm. Ledgers.

01:18:52.632 --> 01:18:55.127
SAM: Oh, maybe we don't want any of this on the
record for right now.

01:18:55.127 --> 01:18:58.864
MATT: "Okay. Remember that for the negotiation."

01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:00.989
SAM: Oh shit.

01:19:00.989 --> 01:19:08.985
MATT: Captain winks at her. "All right, so, we're
very busy, our books are full and we have a few

01:19:08.985 --> 01:19:15.360
"other individuals that are currently seeking use
of our ship. So what is it you need, where are you

01:19:15.360 --> 01:19:16.689
"going and for how long?"

01:19:16.689 --> 01:19:21.281
SAM: This would be a week or less for the
mission.

01:19:21.281 --> 01:19:24.063
TRAVIS: Looking to leave quite soon.

01:19:24.063 --> 01:19:25.393
SAM: Maybe even tomorrow morning.

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.571
MATT: "All right."

01:19:26.571 --> 01:19:28.924
SAM: We'd be going north. Correct?

01:19:28.924 --> 01:19:29.892
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:19:29.892 --> 01:19:35.805
SAM: Into the Ozmit Sea, and to a location that we
would disclose to you once we get airborne.

01:19:35.805 --> 01:19:41.405
MATT: You hear a voice in the back, "Also consider
that in the negotiation."

01:19:41.405 --> 01:19:49.200
SAM: But also consider this. We are on a mission
that's very important to the security of both

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:54.946
Marquet and other continents, and we have friends
in high places. And I will flash our little badge.

01:19:54.946 --> 01:19:56.247
TRAVIS: Yes!

01:19:56.247 --> 01:19:59.482
SAM: The badge that J'Mon Sa Ord gave us.

01:19:59.482 --> 01:20:02.071
LIAM: Not your fake little star from pre-show?

01:20:02.071 --> 01:20:05.231
MATT: He looks down and he goes, "That looks very
pretty."

01:20:05.231 --> 01:20:09.133
TRAVIS: Oh, this is given from J'mon Sa Ord.

01:20:09.133 --> 01:20:13.673
MATT: "I don't know who that is."

01:20:13.673 --> 01:20:16.262
SAM: Yes, I didn't think you would--

01:20:16.262 --> 01:20:20.056
MATT: The clerk, however, says, "Wait, you're
saying you got something from J'mon Sa Ord. You

01:20:20.056 --> 01:20:22.607
"saw J'mon Sa Ord, and you were given something."

01:20:22.607 --> 01:20:23.895
TRAVIS and SAM: Yes.

01:20:23.895 --> 01:20:26.541
MATT: (laughter) "Let me see this."

01:20:26.541 --> 01:20:27.905
SAM: I hand it over.

01:20:27.905 --> 01:20:31.023
MATT: She looks at it. (laughter fades)

01:20:31.023 --> 01:20:37.307
(laughter)

01:20:37.307 --> 01:20:41.011
MATT: "Very well."

01:20:41.055 --> 01:20:45.677
TRAVIS: Consider that in negotiation.

01:20:45.677 --> 01:20:56.789
MATT: She looks over and meets eyes with the
captain and goes, "We're going to go ahead, you

01:20:56.789 --> 01:21:00.564
"let me know the price and the palace is going to
pay for this expedition."

01:21:00.564 --> 01:21:03.886
SAM: I didn't know it would do that!

01:21:03.886 --> 01:21:10.088
LAURA: That is the most valuable necklace!

01:21:10.088 --> 01:21:17.681
MATT: Opens the book and begins writing down a
series of charges and is racking up--

01:21:17.681 --> 01:21:19.336
LIAM: You just Babe Ruth-ed that shit!

01:21:19.336 --> 01:21:21.659
MARISHA: Company card, man.

01:21:21.659 --> 01:21:27.111
SAM: We'll probably need sparkling water, stat.
Lots of brandy for the trip.

01:21:27.111 --> 01:21:30.803
TRAVIS: Maybe some servants and some masseuses.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:38.089
SAM: Yes. I will definitely need someone with a
knowledge of the sea, both in the air and down

01:21:38.089 --> 01:21:39.722
below, the waters below.

01:21:39.722 --> 01:21:47.370
MATT: The captain says, "Actually we've got an
individual just for that." He looks back to the

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:54.145
clerk, "Are you sure?" "Yes, it's fine, not a
worry. We'll talk when they leave."

01:21:54.145 --> 01:22:00.932
TRAVIS: Don't mind me, but I have violence on the
mind at all times. Is there any customary weaponry

01:22:00.932 --> 01:22:05.302
or defense that you can put on this airship during
our travels? Just in case we run into the same

01:22:05.302 --> 01:22:08.224
shit we did last time.

01:22:08.224 --> 01:22:14.615
MATT: The captain goes, "Actually, after the
encounter we had over the Ozmit last time, I

01:22:14.615 --> 01:22:22.656
"managed to outfit this ship with a brand new
series of dragon arbalests, so this is going to be

01:22:22.656 --> 01:22:23.909
"a well-defended journey."

01:22:23.909 --> 01:22:25.479
TRAVIS: Nice. Do they aim in all directions?

01:22:25.479 --> 01:22:26.744
MATT: "You'll see."

01:22:26.744 --> 01:22:27.779
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:22:27.779 --> 01:22:34.505
MATT: And you do recall seeing them when you were
in Vasselheim, you saw them being brought down and

01:22:34.505 --> 01:22:36.849
installed on the ship. But that was last time you
saw the ship.

01:22:36.849 --> 01:22:41.038
SAM: Can the ship be prepared to leave tomorrow
morning?

01:22:41.038 --> 01:22:47.335
MATT: "We can leave in the next hour, if you
want."

01:22:47.335 --> 01:22:51.297
TRAVIS: Stand at the ready, our business is of
great import.

01:22:51.297 --> 01:22:57.489
SAM: Yes, Grog. Yes it is. I think you should ring
the bell to make this an official deal.

01:22:57.489 --> 01:22:58.687
TRAVIS: Can I ring the bell?

01:22:58.687 --> 01:23:00.482
MATT: You can if you want to.

01:23:00.482 --> 01:23:03.778
TRAVIS: But I don't grab it and ring it, I go
(clang) one loud time.

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:14.649
MATT: The ringing is discordant and painful in
proximity and the clerk went (groaning). The

01:23:14.649 --> 01:23:20.526
captain chuckles to himself. "So. In the
morning."

01:23:20.526 --> 01:23:24.154
SAM: We'll have to discuss with our associates,
but be prepared as quickly as possible.

01:23:24.154 --> 01:23:26.323
MATT: "All right. I'll assemble the crew and we'll
be ready within the hour."

01:23:26.323 --> 01:23:27.824
SAM: Excellent.

01:23:27.824 --> 01:23:35.408
TRAVIS: How many of your crew will you have with
you? Just ballpark it.

01:23:35.408 --> 01:23:44.409
MATT: It would be a crew of eight. "Normally
seven, but we have eight now."

01:23:44.409 --> 01:23:49.174
TRAVIS: And I'm sure this crew is your finest. No
greenhorns. Men you've spent years with, trust

01:23:49.174 --> 01:23:50.067
your life with.

01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:51.188
MATT: "Most of them, yes."

01:23:51.188 --> 01:23:53.726
TRAVIS: Most of them. How many do you not trust
your life with?

01:23:53.726 --> 01:23:56.764
MATT: "There is one we've had on board for a short
time, but she's definitely proven worthy."

01:23:56.764 --> 01:24:01.523
TRAVIS: Perhaps she should stay behind on this
voyage.

01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:04.356
MATT: "She's the one with the mastery of the
ocean."

01:24:04.356 --> 01:24:08.450
TRAVIS: She's coming with us.

01:24:08.517 --> 01:24:15.230
SAM: Thank you, Damon. Oh, one more thing. I asked
you this last time, but are you still single?

01:24:15.298 --> 01:24:17.484
MATT: "Yes?"

01:24:17.484 --> 01:24:19.000
SAM: Okay, good to know.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.777
TRAVIS: Don't worry about him, there's a hubbub
down in the quarter. People talking. It's the gold

01:24:22.777 --> 01:24:23.807
armor.

01:24:23.807 --> 01:24:25.841
MATT: "I'm going to go ready my ship."

01:24:25.841 --> 01:24:31.853
TRAVIS: Yep. Good! We'll be back. Why did you ask
him if he was single? That was so awkward.

01:24:31.853 --> 01:24:33.965
SAM: Because Vex really liked him last time.

01:24:33.965 --> 01:24:35.972
TRAVIS: Yeah, I know, but he thought you liked
him. Now we have to--

01:24:35.972 --> 01:24:38.646
SAM: You know what, everyone thinks I like them.
That's part of my wink-y charm.

01:24:38.646 --> 01:24:41.049
TRAVIS: I thought you said that it's part of your
winky, I'm like, that's not--

01:24:41.049 --> 01:24:42.471
SAM: (nudge-wink sound)

01:24:42.471 --> 01:24:50.537
MATT: All right. You guys seemingly locked
passage.

01:24:50.537 --> 01:24:52.815
TRAVIS: Boom. For free, bitch! On the house!

01:24:52.815 --> 01:24:54.333
SAM: We could have been using this all over the
place!

01:24:54.333 --> 01:24:56.858
TRAVIS: I know. It's an AmEx Black Card.

01:24:56.858 --> 01:25:00.699
SAM: Real quick, guys. Real quick.

01:25:00.699 --> 01:25:02.105
TRAVIS: We make our way back.

01:25:02.105 --> 01:25:09.489
SAM: Real quick, though, on the way back I'm going
to go to the casino. Just real quick.

01:25:09.489 --> 01:25:10.720
LAURA: (yells) Scanlan!

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:11.996
TALIESIN: No, hold out. Let's see this.

01:25:11.996 --> 01:25:14.180
TRAVIS: Yep. I'm with him. I'm with you.

01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:20.823
MATT: Now you, guiding back, head right towards
the Luck's Run.

01:25:20.823 --> 01:25:25.156
TRAVIS: I don't know if this is where our friends
are.

01:25:25.156 --> 01:25:26.541
SAM: It's a shortcut, friend.

01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:27.612
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

01:25:27.612 --> 01:25:33.021
SAM: We get outside, I pull Grog into a little
alleyway and I say: Listen, friend. I'm going to

01:25:33.021 --> 01:25:36.191
go in there and do a little business. Can you do
me a favor?

01:25:36.191 --> 01:25:38.771
TRAVIS: Play some music outside while you go
number two?

01:25:38.771 --> 01:25:44.481
SAM: I need you to keep your eyes open. Can I
Minor Illusion a face of one of those guys who did

01:25:44.481 --> 01:25:46.192
the deal with me?

01:25:46.192 --> 01:25:50.289
MATT: Yeah, you could. It's a still image, it
makes no sound. It's very much an illusion--

01:25:50.289 --> 01:25:57.653
SAM: Yeah, it's for him. To show him what he looks
like. This face, look at it. Lock it in. I do the

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.418
other face as well. This face, you see it?

01:26:00.418 --> 01:26:01.794
TRAVIS: Is there a test on this later?

01:26:01.794 --> 01:26:04.653
SAM: There's only one test. If you see these
people, grab them.

01:26:04.653 --> 01:26:05.976
TRAVIS: Grab them. And then what?

01:26:05.976 --> 01:26:07.989
SAM: Do what Grog does best.

01:26:07.989 --> 01:26:10.792
TRAVIS: Just do what I do best when I see them?

01:26:10.792 --> 01:26:15.697
SAM: Yes. But you won't see them unless they leave
the casino. Just stay out here at the door.

01:26:15.697 --> 01:26:16.520
TRAVIS: Outside?

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.493
SAM: Yes.

01:26:17.493 --> 01:26:18.639
TRAVIS: Cool.

01:26:18.639 --> 01:26:20.124
SAM: You're my lookout man.

01:26:20.124 --> 01:26:23.736
TRAVIS: Should I have a code word if you know
they're coming out, like--

01:26:23.736 --> 01:26:27.886
SAM: Yeah, let's come up with one right now.
Yeah.

01:26:27.886 --> 01:26:30.575
TRAVIS: Dijon.

01:26:30.575 --> 01:26:33.515
SAM: Yeah. There it is. Dijon.

01:26:33.515 --> 01:26:36.996
MATT: All right. Grog, you taking watch, you head
into the casino.

01:26:36.996 --> 01:26:40.115
SAM: Oh! Before I go in, hat of disguise on.

01:26:40.115 --> 01:26:44.775
MATT: What do you wish to look like?

01:26:44.775 --> 01:26:57.280
SAM: Adult human male. Goatee, pork pie hat, black
jacket. Just an ordinary man.

01:26:57.336 --> 01:26:59.537
LIAM: Yeah, Mr. Shorthalt! Yeah!

01:26:59.537 --> 01:27:02.082
TALIESIN: Is it Abbott or Costello? I'm not sure
which.

01:27:02.082 --> 01:27:07.154
MATT: And you walk into the Luck's Run. Being
midday, it's not as busy as the evening you saw

01:27:07.154 --> 01:27:12.534
previously but I'd say about half the tables are
still running and they have clientele throughout.

01:27:12.534 --> 01:27:18.336
SAM: I'm looking, in the interest of time, going
to look around for any of those two faces.

01:27:18.336 --> 01:27:21.002
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.617
LIAM: That's bardic magic, bitch.

01:27:22.617 --> 01:27:23.940
SAM: Nine.

01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:31.413
MATT: You spend the better part of a half an hour
scoping through each floor. No sign.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:35.024
SAM: I didn't go into their office, though,
right?

01:27:35.024 --> 01:27:40.901
MATT: No. Through the bottom floor, and going up
and checking hallways. And the third floor, which

01:27:40.901 --> 01:27:46.172
you hadn't been before, which is more of a lounge
patio. It has more of the higher stakes games. You

01:27:46.172 --> 01:27:48.550
can see there are some more of the higher rollers
and--

01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:52.466
SAM: And can I make my way to the office area,
where they led me?

01:27:52.466 --> 01:27:54.169
MATT: Yeah. I mean, the door is closed.

01:27:54.169 --> 01:27:55.945
SAM: Can I listen outside?

01:27:55.945 --> 01:27:59.930
MATT: Yeah, you take a listen. Doesn't appear to
be any sound from the other side.

01:27:59.930 --> 01:28:00.825
SAM: Damn it.

01:28:00.825 --> 01:28:04.300
TRAVIS: Can I go to the corner where I can see the
front entrance and the side alley where I was and

01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.570
look and see if I see either of those two faces?

01:28:06.570 --> 01:28:08.301
MATT: Sure, make a perception check.

01:28:08.301 --> 01:28:11.505
TRAVIS: This will go well. Total shit. Six.

01:28:11.505 --> 01:28:14.943
MATT: Six. No sign of them.

01:28:14.943 --> 01:28:17.031
TRAVIS: Cool. I'm looking at the wall.

01:28:17.031 --> 01:28:19.456
SAM: Damn it. All right. I'll quickly Dimension
Door inside the office.

01:28:19.456 --> 01:28:26.364
MATT: (whoosh) Inside the office. Thankfully you
have your gnomish dark vision. It is dark in here,

01:28:26.364 --> 01:28:31.201
there are no lights. The table and chairs and the
general decor of the room seemingly untouched

01:28:31.201 --> 01:28:32.604
since last time you were in here.

01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:37.378
SAM: All right. Is there any source of light
around here?

01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:39.794
MATT: There are a couple of lanterns in the corner
that could be lit.

01:28:39.794 --> 01:28:41.078
SAM: I will light one.

01:28:41.078 --> 01:28:46.139
MATT: All right. (whoosh) You turn the lantern up.
Light glows.

01:28:46.139 --> 01:28:52.713
SAM: Going right into the desk, looking for
anything. Keys, gold, contraband, weapons.

01:28:52.713 --> 01:28:54.153
MATT: Investigation check.

01:28:54.153 --> 01:28:56.451
SAM: 23.

01:28:56.451 --> 01:29:09.800
MATT: 23. Scanning through you find the odd four
copper pieces. You find a couple of small books.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:15.739
One looks like it's on etiquette, and the other is
written in a language you don't understand. But

01:29:15.739 --> 01:29:25.555
you gather it's Marquesian. You do also find some
small notes-- like a little name that is drawn on

01:29:25.555 --> 01:29:29.982
the inside of one of the drawers. Looks old, like
it's been there for a long time, and says "Lelan."

01:29:29.982 --> 01:29:41.897
And you find-- that's about it. You get the sense
this isn't a stationary room that they use as a

01:29:41.897 --> 01:29:44.988
base of operations, it's almost like a rental
space used when people want to come in here and do

01:29:44.988 --> 01:29:48.354
business. Which happens often in a casino
establishment. They want to make sure that they

01:29:48.354 --> 01:29:52.569
provide their clientele with all the necessary
needs, and a lot of the rooms on this center floor

01:29:52.569 --> 01:29:57.814
are to facilitate the meetings between the top and
the bottom.

01:29:57.814 --> 01:30:01.084
SAM: Damn it. All right, I'll do one more
investigation check to see if there's any hidden

01:30:01.084 --> 01:30:04.574
compartments in the desk or around it.

01:30:04.574 --> 01:30:06.971
TRAVIS: Burn it to the ground.

01:30:06.971 --> 01:30:08.627
SAM: 24.

01:30:08.627 --> 01:30:16.367
MATT: 24. Nothing under the desks, but the table
that you're at, there is a small false bottom on

01:30:16.367 --> 01:30:23.597
each side. You pull it open and there is a single
dagger on each end. Apparently for those that

01:30:23.597 --> 01:30:29.622
know, they're provided as a means of defense in
case things in one of these meetings go wrong. But

01:30:29.622 --> 01:30:32.374
who knows who knows this information. It looks
like they haven't been used in a while.

01:30:32.374 --> 01:30:33.207
SAM: All right.

01:30:33.207 --> 01:30:35.206
TRAVIS: Can I look around and see if I see the two
faces now?

01:30:35.206 --> 01:30:37.913
MATT: Sure, make another perception check.

01:30:37.913 --> 01:30:40.034
TRAVIS: 18.

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:41.550
MATT: Nope.

01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:50.773
SAM: All right, fine. I will take the daggers,
take the Marquesian book, whatever that was, take

01:30:50.773 --> 01:30:59.889
a huge dump on the desk, and take one of the
daggers and dig a big piece of it and write on the

01:30:59.889 --> 01:31:02.011
wall, "The Meat Man cometh."

01:31:02.011 --> 01:31:03.774
(laughing)

01:31:03.774 --> 01:31:07.803
TALIESIN: Wouldn't it be, "The Meat Man goeth?" Oh
well, never mind.

01:31:07.803 --> 01:31:09.804
SAM: And then I'll let myself out.

01:31:09.804 --> 01:31:18.121
MATT: Okay. You open the door. There are two
people walking through. They glance over at you

01:31:18.121 --> 01:31:23.331
and keep walking. You close the door behind you
and you have left your mark.

01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:27.070
SAM: Okay. On the way out of the casino do I see
any familiar faces?

01:31:27.070 --> 01:31:28.718
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:31:28.718 --> 01:31:29.836
SAM: 18!

01:31:29.836 --> 01:31:30.954
MATT: 18. Nah.

01:31:30.954 --> 01:31:32.101
SAM: Ah, fuck you!

01:31:32.101 --> 01:31:35.802
MATT: They seemingly know better than to return to
the scene of the crime.

01:31:35.802 --> 01:31:37.813
SAM: All right.

01:31:37.813 --> 01:31:44.864
MATT: For lesser folk, 400 gold can keep you going
for quite some time.

01:31:44.864 --> 01:31:47.208
TRAVIS: Put some money on red or black while
you're in there. Just once.

01:31:47.208 --> 01:31:50.193
SAM: All right.

01:31:50.193 --> 01:31:53.396
LAURA: You should try the dice game just once.

01:31:53.396 --> 01:31:54.944
SAM: The dice game?

01:31:54.944 --> 01:31:55.845
LAURA: Yeah.

01:31:55.845 --> 01:31:56.868
SAM: All right. Grog?

01:31:56.868 --> 01:31:57.848
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:31:57.848 --> 01:32:00.244
SAM: Want to come in and play once with me?

01:32:00.244 --> 01:32:01.268
TRAVIS: No.

01:32:01.268 --> 01:32:02.437
SAM: Okay, great.

01:32:02.437 --> 01:32:04.606
(laughter)

01:32:04.606 --> 01:32:06.026
SAM: I'll do the dice game once.

01:32:06.026 --> 01:32:12.584
MATT: Okay, all right. So you walk in to the
table. There's three other individuals there. Hold

01:32:12.584 --> 01:32:17.585
on, let me get prepared here. Since this is the
first time we're really doing this here, which is

01:32:17.585 --> 01:32:20.156
kind of fun. All righty.

01:32:20.156 --> 01:32:21.670
TALIESIN: No, this is like, the third run.

01:32:21.670 --> 01:32:23.405
LAURA: Isn't this the seven or the twelve game?

01:32:23.405 --> 01:32:25.758
MATT: Oh, the dice game! Dice game, I'm sorry.

01:32:25.758 --> 01:32:28.364
SAM: What's the other game?

01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:32.806
MATT: Well the dice game's cool. There's the dice
game, the lizards, and the card game. Your call.

01:32:32.806 --> 01:32:34.177
MARISHA: What's the card game?

01:32:34.177 --> 01:32:35.354
MATT: Dice game is the 2d6--

01:32:35.354 --> 01:32:38.159
SAM: What's the fastest one? Let's do that one.

01:32:38.159 --> 01:32:39.990
MATT: The fastest one is the dice game. The card
game takes a little more time.

01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:41.298
SAM: Okay.

01:32:41.298 --> 01:32:46.262
MATT: All right, so. That is a 25 gold minimum buy
in for Avandra's Favor.

01:32:46.262 --> 01:32:48.160
TRAVIS: Even in the middle of the day, the
minimums don't go down?

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.202
LAURA: I know, I feel like the minimums should go
down in the middle of the day.

01:32:50.202 --> 01:32:51.304
SAM: 50 gold.

01:32:51.304 --> 01:32:52.793
MATT: You've never been to Ank'Harel!

01:32:52.793 --> 01:32:54.688
SAM: 50 gold!

01:32:54.688 --> 01:32:56.172
TRAVIS: Well I've been to Harrah's!

01:32:56.172 --> 01:32:57.953
MATT: The minimums stay where they are.

01:32:57.953 --> 01:32:59.225
SAM: 50 gold.

01:32:59.225 --> 01:33:05.526
MATT: All right, you throw 50 gold down. As you
slap it down, still in your human guise, an

01:33:05.526 --> 01:33:12.718
individual to the left of you goes, "Whew. All
right. Big, strong opening and strong scent."

01:33:12.718 --> 01:33:17.485
Scoots over a bit to the right. Go ahead and roll
your dice.

01:33:17.485 --> 01:33:18.910
SAM: Six.

01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:19.939
MATT: Six.

01:33:19.939 --> 01:33:21.031
LAURA: Double down!

01:33:21.031 --> 01:33:23.195
MATT: He goes, "Mm. That's unfortunate."

01:33:23.195 --> 01:33:24.876
TALIESIN: Six is the double down, isn't it? Six is
the double down.

01:33:24.876 --> 01:33:25.806
LAURA: Yeah!

01:33:25.806 --> 01:33:28.865
MATT: "You can go ahead and double the price to
add an additional 1d6. You're going for seven or 12."

01:33:28.865 --> 01:33:30.556
SAM: Sure, yeah.

01:33:30.556 --> 01:33:31.963
TALIESIN: So roll one more die.

01:33:31.963 --> 01:33:34.681
MATT: "So 100 gold on the table. Roll one more
dice. You want a one--"

01:33:34.681 --> 01:33:36.173
MARISHA: --or a six.

01:33:36.173 --> 01:33:37.773
SAM: I got a five.

01:33:37.773 --> 01:33:38.882
MARISHA: Aww.

01:33:38.882 --> 01:33:43.673
MATT: "I am very sorry my friend." Shifts the coin
away. 100 gold down now.

01:33:43.673 --> 01:33:47.677
SAM: I just say: I hate this casino.

01:33:47.677 --> 01:33:49.561
(laughter)

01:33:49.561 --> 01:33:51.305
MATT: Any other games you want to play?

01:33:51.305 --> 01:34:02.500
SAM: No! No, I leave. Goddammit. Wait, what was
the names? The names that they gave me? The two

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:04.226
guys gave me?

01:34:04.226 --> 01:34:06.007
MATT: Oh! Oh, right.

01:34:06.007 --> 01:34:07.177
SAM: Grug, or something.

01:34:07.177 --> 01:34:15.170
MATT: That was Rutur was the half orc. And I have
to go look up what the other one was.

01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:20.905
SAM: It's fine. I'll ask the dealer, or the dicer,
if he's seen Rutur around.

01:34:20.905 --> 01:34:23.602
MATT: He kind of--

01:34:23.602 --> 01:34:30.891
SAM: Jesus Christ. Five more gold.

01:34:30.891 --> 01:34:38.087
MATT: "Ah, yes. Rutur makes his way around here on
occasion. Every couple weeks, maybe."

01:34:38.087 --> 01:34:40.211
(laughter)

01:34:40.211 --> 01:34:43.169
LIAM: This city has had its way with you, Scanlan
Shorthalt.

01:34:43.169 --> 01:34:45.062
TALIESIN: You're never going to get a kiss.

01:34:45.062 --> 01:34:47.324
TRAVIS: Take your finger out of my asshole, Gary.

01:34:47.324 --> 01:34:50.679
MATT: "He doesn't seem to carry much change with
him."

01:34:50.679 --> 01:34:55.490
(laughter)

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:59.172
SAM: Are you trying to do this to me on purpose?

01:34:59.172 --> 01:35:03.558
MATT: He looks at you strangely. "Hm?"

01:35:03.558 --> 01:35:06.272
LIAM: You talking to Matt?

01:35:06.272 --> 01:35:08.203
MATT: You keep coming back man, I don't know.

01:35:08.203 --> 01:35:10.629
SAM: Fine.

01:35:10.629 --> 01:35:13.827
TRAVIS: Do I see any half orcs outside?

01:35:13.827 --> 01:35:16.502
MATT: You do not at the moment.

01:35:16.502 --> 01:35:17.591
TRAVIS: Damn it.

01:35:17.591 --> 01:35:21.612
MATT: There is still Quon A Drensal or Gambit of
Ord if you're feeling lucky and you want to make

01:35:21.612 --> 01:35:22.571
your money back.

01:35:22.571 --> 01:35:33.042
SAM: Not in a million years, no! This place, it
sucks all my mojo. It's like the anti-mojo.

01:35:33.042 --> 01:35:37.641
TALIESIN: I feel a valuable lesson has finally
been learned, for the first time in this game.

01:35:37.641 --> 01:35:43.822
SAM: All right, I leave. And I go out and I say,
Grog, let's go home. But before we do, slap me in

01:35:43.822 --> 01:35:45.129
the face really hard.

01:35:45.129 --> 01:35:46.011
TRAVIS: You're sure?

01:35:46.011 --> 01:35:47.391
SAM: Yes, I need it. I need it.

01:35:47.391 --> 01:35:49.377
TRAVIS: Really hard. You want me to use the
gauntlets or no?

01:35:49.377 --> 01:35:50.176
SAM: No.

01:35:50.176 --> 01:35:52.111
LIAM: If he doesn't roll for damage then I'm going
to be offended.

01:35:52.111 --> 01:35:58.602
TRAVIS: All right, I take the Titanstone Knuckle
off my left hand and I slap him.

01:35:58.602 --> 01:36:02.479
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll a strength
check.

01:36:02.479 --> 01:36:07.546
TRAVIS: 18.

01:36:07.546 --> 01:36:13.126
MATT: All right. You take five points of damage.

01:36:13.126 --> 01:36:18.188
TALIESIN: Is he still wearing the disguise? Is he
wearing the hat of disguise?

01:36:18.188 --> 01:36:19.277
SAM: Yes. Of course.

01:36:19.277 --> 01:36:20.172
MATT: He is.

01:36:20.172 --> 01:36:22.252
TALIESIN: So would his head not be, necessarily,
where his--

01:36:22.252 --> 01:36:27.474
MATT: That's true, and with Grog being not the one
who would remember that or recall that, he goes--

01:36:27.474 --> 01:36:31.993
SAM: I can't even get slapped in the face right!

01:36:31.993 --> 01:36:35.115
TALIESIN: I will ruin everything! I will ruin
everything!

01:36:35.115 --> 01:36:37.189
MATT: It's a valid point, thank you for
remembering.

01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:40.019
TRAVIS: I was so confused why a stranger would ask
me to slap him.

01:36:40.019 --> 01:36:44.107
(laughter)

01:36:44.107 --> 01:36:45.941
SAM: We go home.

01:36:45.941 --> 01:36:51.376
LIAM: Wait. So way faster than the casino trip,
while we've been waiting so long, Percival has

01:36:51.376 --> 01:36:55.498
been acting fucking twitchy since we found that
body so I walk over to him sitting off at a table.

01:36:55.498 --> 01:37:01.512
Hey, Mr. Cool-as-a-cucumber. Shush. Or come with
me, come have a seat.

01:37:01.512 --> 01:37:03.186
LAURA: Okay, all right, I'm here.

01:37:03.186 --> 01:37:09.400
LIAM: What's the matter? Yeah, it's her again.
We're going to find her. It's fine. You're huffing

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:14.641
and hawing since we found her body. It's fine.
What's going on?

01:37:14.641 --> 01:37:26.517
TALIESIN: I was really hoping she was going to go
away. That's all. I was really hoping that she was

01:37:26.517 --> 01:37:28.116
just going to go away.

01:37:28.116 --> 01:37:30.459
LIAM: Well she's going to go away, Percival. If
not now, later.

01:37:30.459 --> 01:37:45.861
TALIESIN: Every second she's alive is untold
damage to the world. Do you know how every now and

01:37:45.861 --> 01:37:48.035
then I say something awful?

01:37:48.035 --> 01:37:49.398
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

01:37:49.398 --> 01:37:59.817
TALIESIN: I love you both very much for that. When
I think of that terrible person inside of me I see

01:37:59.817 --> 01:38:15.607
her face. She has a very active imagination. She
knows how to make these machines, and her

01:38:15.607 --> 01:38:31.512
imagination terrifies me. If you knew that that
was me, would you let me live? Has she made ten

01:38:31.512 --> 01:38:39.698
more of these things, has she made 100? Does she
hand them out to people? Maybe, I don't know,

01:38:39.698 --> 01:38:45.869
maybe she's running around and torturing people's
parents and siblings to death and then handing

01:38:45.869 --> 01:38:49.176
them a gun and kicking them out into the world to
see what will happen because it could be funny.

01:38:49.176 --> 01:38:55.031
LIAM: You're probably right, Percival. She
probably is. This is not Lord and Lady Briarwood

01:38:55.031 --> 01:38:56.495
over again, though.

01:38:56.495 --> 01:38:57.487
TALIESIN: No, it's not.

01:38:57.487 --> 01:38:58.859
LIAM: And you're not alone.

01:38:58.859 --> 01:38:59.905
TALIESIN: No, I'm not.

01:38:59.905 --> 01:39:04.601
LIAM: You have me, you have her. You have her. You
have the other two Laurel and Hardy motherfuckers

01:39:04.601 --> 01:39:05.631
who aren't back yet.

01:39:05.631 --> 01:39:07.417
TALIESIN: I was so hoping that maybe--

01:39:07.417 --> 01:39:11.811
MARISHA: I slam some mead in front of him.

01:39:11.811 --> 01:39:16.650
TALIESIN: Thank you. I was hoping something heavy
had fallen on her from a great height, saving the

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:20.089
world a few thousand lives.

01:39:20.089 --> 01:39:25.030
LAURA: Well, we're going to be above her. Maybe we
can be the one to drop something heavy.

01:39:25.030 --> 01:39:26.956
TALIESIN: That's really what I'm hoping.

01:39:26.956 --> 01:39:29.928
MARISHA: Oh, I've been practicing that actually. I
can be really heavy.

01:39:29.928 --> 01:39:31.224
TALIESIN: That may help.

01:39:31.224 --> 01:39:31.975
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:39:31.975 --> 01:39:38.985
TALIESIN: She is the biggest mistake I've made,
and I'm horrified by who's paid the price.

01:39:38.985 --> 01:39:43.817
LIAM: All the more reason for you to be the same
cold-hearted asshole you've been for the last

01:39:43.817 --> 01:39:47.567
year. Why change now? Get the job done, Percival.

01:39:47.567 --> 01:39:49.675
TALIESIN: I'm counting to a hundred. I'll be
fine.

01:39:49.675 --> 01:39:52.989
MARISHA: It's not very often we see you shaky,
Percy.

01:39:52.989 --> 01:39:59.460
TALIESIN: Once we're out of here, I'll feel fine.
Once that thing is off my machine I will feel

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:06.514
fine. And I'm thinking of something else. I'm
thinking of building something awful to help deal

01:40:06.514 --> 01:40:07.707
with her.

01:40:07.707 --> 01:40:13.681
MARISHA: Hang on. Wait. Hang on. I was about to
ask if you ever have regrets of building something

01:40:13.681 --> 01:40:18.550
awful and releasing it into this world, and now
you just said you're going to double down,

01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:19.752
essentially?

01:40:19.752 --> 01:40:26.993
TALIESIN: I've been thinking long and hard about
it. I think inevitably, anytime I think of

01:40:26.993 --> 01:40:33.854
something it might be too late. I think I'm going
to be very careful about what I build. I'm going

01:40:33.854 --> 01:40:41.745
to be very careful about where it goes, and I'm
also going to ask anybody, if-- when I die, destroy

01:40:41.745 --> 01:40:50.491
everything. Please. This is why I don't write down
notes. Any of my sketches, they're put away, and

01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:58.866
they're put in a place where I can remove them
once the job is done. But I sketch my idle

01:40:58.866 --> 01:41:04.569
thoughts, and right now I'm having an idle thought
for her and it's simple, it's nothing complicated,

01:41:04.569 --> 01:41:06.395
it's just vicious.

01:41:06.395 --> 01:41:11.658
LIAM: Well all right, we can do that. We can
destroy anything you make, but for now, Percy.

01:41:11.658 --> 01:41:14.499
Keep your head, man.

01:41:14.499 --> 01:41:16.266
TALIESIN: One night of sleep, I'll be there.

01:41:16.266 --> 01:41:22.164
MARISHA: What exactly are you thinking of making?
Just because we could destroy your notes, I mean,

01:41:22.164 --> 01:41:26.714
you're still alive and your guns still got into
the world.

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:35.317
LAURA: Regardless of what he makes, who wields it?
Fenthras is a horrible weapon wielded by a

01:41:35.317 --> 01:41:40.784
horrible being before I had it. A gun can do the
same thing.

01:41:40.784 --> 01:41:45.784
MARISHA: You're arguably one of the greatest minds
in existence right now, Percival.

01:41:45.784 --> 01:41:47.688
TALIESIN: That's a terrible thought.

01:41:47.688 --> 01:41:52.270
MARISHA: But you are. And Vex isn't wrong.

01:41:52.270 --> 01:42:01.428
TALIESIN: I know. There are things that one day I
will speak of that I'm not really ready to deal

01:42:01.428 --> 01:42:06.605
with yet. But I think I may even have something
that could help us with the dragons. I have a

01:42:06.605 --> 01:42:10.797
thought. I'm going to work on it on our way to the
island.

01:42:10.797 --> 01:42:12.316
LIAM: Now I'm nervous.

01:42:12.316 --> 01:42:20.307
TALIESIN: It will be something that once the
dragons are felled I plan on destroying

01:42:20.307 --> 01:42:28.122
immediately after. And I think you'll be all right
with it when you see it, it's too complicated for

01:42:28.122 --> 01:42:32.767
any one person to really deal with. But I will
feel much better if she is in the ground.

01:42:32.767 --> 01:42:34.440
LAURA: Well I'm interested in seeing it.

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:40.932
MARISHA: Percy. You know you can talk to us,
right? You never share ideas with us.

01:42:40.932 --> 01:42:45.784
TALIESIN: I do. I told you my idea of killing all
the dragonborn to start a war between the

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:47.210
dragons.

01:42:47.210 --> 01:42:48.887
MARISHA: All right, well.

01:42:48.887 --> 01:42:51.255
TALIESIN: That's why I don't share those ideas,
I'm not proud of them.

01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:57.014
LAURA: Is this thing you're building going to kill
a lot of people in addition to the dragon?

01:42:57.014 --> 01:43:02.864
TALIESIN: I hope not, but it could. It could make
it very easy to kill a lot of people.

01:43:02.864 --> 01:43:08.851
LIAM: One day at a time, gang. Let's deal with
Ripley first.

01:43:08.851 --> 01:43:15.249
TALIESIN: Let's deal with Ripley. Let's collect a
few more things that will help us deal with home.

01:43:15.249 --> 01:43:25.681
Let's save home. And then I will spend some good
time undoing some of the damage that I've done. I

01:43:25.681 --> 01:43:27.991
should have killed her. I should have.

01:43:27.991 --> 01:43:37.408
MARISHA: You shouldn't feel regret about not
taking another person's life. It's a moment of

01:43:37.408 --> 01:43:38.746
humanity.

01:43:38.746 --> 01:43:43.633
TALIESIN: It wasn't. I was not being kind, I was
being selfish. I didn't kill her because the

01:43:43.633 --> 01:43:48.858
Briarwoods mattered more to me, even though I
knew that she was far more dangerous. That if

01:43:48.858 --> 01:43:56.424
they had escaped, the world would be darker, two
more vampires or whatever, but she was the genie

01:43:56.424 --> 01:44:05.603
and I knowingly and very willingly said, I'm fine
with that. And I knew at that moment, this was not

01:44:05.603 --> 01:44:10.904
a thought I had later, in my head, I went, she is
going to kill hundreds of people. And that's okay

01:44:10.904 --> 01:44:11.979
right now.

01:44:11.979 --> 01:44:18.995
LAURA: Percy, if you had stayed with her and let
the Briarwoods go, a god, a terrible god, would

01:44:18.995 --> 01:44:21.773
probably be loosed on the land right now. I
think you chose correctly.

01:44:21.773 --> 01:44:26.306
TALIESIN: I think I stumbled into the correct
answer, I'm not sure I chose correctly. I think I

01:44:26.306 --> 01:44:27.823
got lucky.

01:44:27.823 --> 01:44:33.897
MARISHA: Did you not want to kill her because in a
way you feel responsible for who she is?

01:44:33.897 --> 01:44:40.205
TALIESIN: Oh, I feel absolutely responsible for
inspiring a maniac, of course I do.

01:44:40.205 --> 01:44:45.436
LIAM: Look. We're going to help you get to her.
You're going to get her. You've got to let us in

01:44:45.436 --> 01:44:47.264
on it a bit, though, all right?

01:44:47.264 --> 01:44:52.751
TALIESIN: Once I have something drawn I'll show
you what it is. And I'll have something drawn by

01:44:52.751 --> 01:44:54.109
tomorrow. Something simple.

01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:55.188
LIAM: That's a promise?

01:44:55.188 --> 01:44:56.188
TALIESIN: That is absolutely a promise.

01:44:56.188 --> 01:45:00.531
MARISHA: Also I know you're really smart, but
we're smart too. Don't insult our intelligence by

01:45:00.531 --> 01:45:04.216
assuming we can't comprehend one of your ideas.

01:45:04.216 --> 01:45:10.484
TALIESIN: Oh no you'll comprehend it, and it's not
that I don't think you can comprehend it, I know

01:45:10.484 --> 01:45:14.942
you can, it's that I know what it says about me
that I even thought it.

01:45:14.942 --> 01:45:19.170
MARISHA: Percy. Percy.

01:45:19.170 --> 01:45:21.101
TALIESIN: You've been drinking.

01:45:21.101 --> 01:45:22.340
MARISHA: I have!

01:45:22.340 --> 01:45:27.828
LAURA: Oh, Keyleth! Really? Hold off of the
alcohol. We have a lot to do today.

01:45:27.828 --> 01:45:30.499
MARISHA: We've been through so much!

01:45:30.499 --> 01:45:34.893
LIAM: I think my point has been made. I start
moving Keyleth towards that door for some fresh air.

01:45:34.893 --> 01:45:36.758
LAURA: Please, get her some fresh air.

01:45:36.758 --> 01:45:38.186
MARISHA: I want more mead!

01:45:38.186 --> 01:45:39.241
LIAM: Come on.

01:45:39.241 --> 01:45:40.518
TALIESIN: I'm sorry I'm an idiot.

01:45:40.518 --> 01:45:42.681
MARISHA: I love you, but I hate you, but I love
you.

01:45:42.681 --> 01:45:43.952
LAURA: Percy.

01:45:43.952 --> 01:45:45.705
TALIESIN: I'm fond of you as well. Yes, dear.

01:45:45.705 --> 01:45:47.270
LAURA: You're a better man than you believe.

01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:58.336
TALIESIN: Thank you. I accept that compliment. You
as well, you are a better woman than you believe.

01:45:58.336 --> 01:46:01.269
Doesn't feel good, does it? There you are.

01:46:01.269 --> 01:46:02.907
LAURA: No, it doesn't. Shit.

01:46:02.907 --> 01:46:05.110
TALIESIN: That's what you get for saying things
like that. Terrible person.

01:46:05.110 --> 01:46:07.640
LIAM: Thought for a second you also had one ball.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:12.795
MATT: All right. So your companions arrive.

01:46:12.795 --> 01:46:14.007
TRAVIS: We're back!

01:46:14.007 --> 01:46:18.580
SAM: We're back. Good news, Grog sweet-talked them
into giving us an airship for free.

01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:19.949
LIAM: No shit, Grog!

01:46:19.949 --> 01:46:21.213
SAM: Grog did the whole thing himself.

01:46:21.213 --> 01:46:22.063
LAURA: Wait, what?!

01:46:22.063 --> 01:46:22.873
LIAM: How did you do it?

01:46:22.873 --> 01:46:29.623
TRAVIS: Well, it's a very intricate and detailed
process. Involves a lot of-- you know what? It'll

01:46:29.623 --> 01:46:33.002
be all over your heads, so just say thank you.

01:46:33.002 --> 01:46:36.008
SAM: Let's just say that he's a good reader of
body language.

01:46:36.008 --> 01:46:37.446
LAURA: What the fuck did you do? Did you really?

01:46:37.446 --> 01:46:39.254
SAM: We got an airship for free.

01:46:39.254 --> 01:46:40.532
LIAM: Who's excited now?

01:46:40.532 --> 01:46:42.965
TALIESIN: I'm very excited, that's the best thing
I've heard all day.

01:46:42.965 --> 01:46:44.321
LAURA: Did you steal it? Tell me you didn't do
anything--

01:46:44.321 --> 01:46:50.462
SAM: We did nothing illegal. And to sweeten the
deal, Captain Damon will be our Damon pilot.

01:46:50.462 --> 01:46:52.572
TALIESIN: That Captain Damon.

01:46:52.572 --> 01:46:54.088
TRAVIS: "Our Damon pilot."

01:46:54.088 --> 01:46:59.055
MARISHA: Did you tell him we were the ones with
the wyverns? Because that's what I would have told

01:46:59.055 --> 01:47:02.179
him. Had I been there, theoretically.

01:47:02.179 --> 01:47:04.746
SAM: That thought popped right into my head.

01:47:04.746 --> 01:47:06.004
MARISHA: Really? Okay.

01:47:06.004 --> 01:47:12.574
SAM: And on the way back I won back the 50 gold I
lost on the fusaka.

01:47:12.574 --> 01:47:13.474
TRAVIS: You did!

01:47:13.474 --> 01:47:14.339
SAM: Yeah, yep.

01:47:14.339 --> 01:47:15.416
TALIESIN: Well done!

01:47:15.416 --> 01:47:18.711
SAM: So I'm going to leave Marquet totally
evens.

01:47:18.711 --> 01:47:20.972
LAURA: That's great!

01:47:20.972 --> 01:47:21.911
TALIESIN: That's amazing.

01:47:21.911 --> 01:47:23.067
SAM: Yup, pretty good.

01:47:23.067 --> 01:47:24.055
TALIESIN: I wish I could say that.

01:47:24.055 --> 01:47:25.192
LIAM: Oh cheers to that, cheers.

01:47:25.192 --> 01:47:30.380
SAM: Still batting a thousand, this guy. Unstoppable
me!

01:47:30.380 --> 01:47:33.078
TRAVIS: Now we can leave whenever we're ready.

01:47:33.078 --> 01:47:34.596
SAM: Oh, yeah, let's pack our bags.

01:47:34.596 --> 01:47:35.520
LAURA: Right now?

01:47:35.520 --> 01:47:37.086
SAM: Oh, wait no, we still have to de-curse the
thing.

01:47:37.086 --> 01:47:38.736
LAURA: Oh the enchantment! Right. We're waiting on
that, that's why we're fucking here.

01:47:38.736 --> 01:47:42.129
MATT: You guys go back down to the main area?

01:47:42.129 --> 01:47:43.379
LIAM: So many things.

01:47:43.379 --> 01:47:48.126
LAURA: Shall we bring the weapon down there?

01:47:48.126 --> 01:47:49.579
LIAM: That seems like a bad idea.

01:47:49.579 --> 01:47:51.601
TALIESIN: Once they're here. Actually, yes, why
not?

01:47:51.601 --> 01:47:54.511
LAURA: Yay, then Trinket's with us again.

01:47:54.511 --> 01:47:59.388
MATT: Yes. All so you guys head back down to the
main thoroughfare, or the main area of the

01:47:59.388 --> 01:48:00.884
tavern?

01:48:00.884 --> 01:48:01.957
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:48:01.957 --> 01:48:09.861
MATT: There you see the same folks are there. You
see Treev is there, and you see a shifty-looking

01:48:09.861 --> 01:48:19.709
guy. A rather pointed nose, very shallow features.
And his hands are together, he has a satchel over

01:48:19.709 --> 01:48:25.272
his shoulder, and these long, plain looking robes.
And his thinning, short, dark hair is slicked

01:48:25.272 --> 01:48:30.820
against his skull. He has a thin mustache goatee
right there, and he's sitting at the edge of the

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.186
bar, talking to Treev.

01:48:32.186 --> 01:48:33.732
LAURA: So he looks totally trustworthy.

01:48:33.732 --> 01:48:34.990
MATT: Totally trustworthy.

01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:36.971
MATT: As soon as you guys walk down the stairs--

01:48:36.971 --> 01:48:39.663
LIAM: Is he that picture of you on the carousel?

01:48:39.663 --> 01:48:42.271
MATT: Basically yes, but with the shorter slicked
hair.

01:48:42.271 --> 01:48:44.780
TALIESIN: I'm glad that's a thing again. I really
missed that.

01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:48.708
MATT: I don't know how to take that actually,
based on how I just described the NPC.

01:48:48.708 --> 01:48:50.836
LIAM: It's more the grimace.

01:48:50.836 --> 01:48:54.604
TALIESIN: I suddenly can hear thousands of Twitch
viewers Googling. Googling like mad!

01:48:54.604 --> 01:48:55.922
MATT: Noted.

01:48:55.922 --> 01:48:57.783
LIAM: Whoops. "And then Vax died."

01:48:57.783 --> 01:49:04.504
MATT: Disadvantage for the rest of the episode.
No. Treev goes, "Oh and here they are, the ones

01:49:04.504 --> 01:49:12.685
"who hired your help. Folks, I'd like to introduce
you to Kyme, he's one of our fine allies in the

01:49:12.685 --> 01:49:19.356
"Omnival Library here in the city, and I believe he
can take care of your little problem. So talk."

01:49:19.356 --> 01:49:27.881
And the guy spins around on the stool at the edge
of the bar, and goes, "Okay, so I have been told

01:49:27.881 --> 01:49:39.328
"that you require some sort of disenchantment
type thing. Who am I talking to here? There's a

01:49:39.453 --> 01:49:43.552
"lot of you. You? Okay, come."

01:49:43.552 --> 01:49:52.151
TALIESIN: All right. I have an object-- so
hard to talk to that face.

01:49:52.151 --> 01:49:56.450
LAURA: Scanlan. He seems like the type, you might
want to try selling him some of that fusaka.

01:49:56.450 --> 01:50:00.853
TALIESIN: I have an object that I own that someone
is tracking me with. They are aware of my

01:50:00.853 --> 01:50:05.038
whereabouts, they've put some kind of enchantment
on it. I was wondering if I could transfer that

01:50:05.038 --> 01:50:10.107
enchantment to another object, and send it in a
different direction so that they don't know that we're

01:50:10.107 --> 01:50:11.902
following them.

01:50:11.902 --> 01:50:14.459
MATT: "That's possible, yes."

01:50:14.459 --> 01:50:19.060
TALIESIN: I would even be willing, if possible, to
remove part of the object that I currently own,

01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:21.970
and then replace it with something else if
necessary.

01:50:21.970 --> 01:50:27.536
MATT: "Depending on the strength of the
enchantment, that can take anywhere within the

01:50:27.536 --> 01:50:29.570
"next few weeks."

01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:31.369
TALIESIN: Can I get you a drink? Are you all
right?

01:50:31.369 --> 01:50:33.574
MATT: "Why? Why do you ask?"

01:50:33.574 --> 01:50:34.692
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

01:50:34.692 --> 01:50:35.818
MATT: Make an insight check, yeah.

01:50:35.818 --> 01:50:38.424
LIAM: Yay.

01:50:38.424 --> 01:50:47.271
SAM: May I make a physiological check of his mouth
shape? His jaw seems--

01:50:47.271 --> 01:50:49.715
LIAM: New Matt character!

01:50:49.715 --> 01:50:51.528
TALIESIN: I know.

01:50:51.528 --> 01:50:54.355
LAURA: 19.

01:50:54.355 --> 01:50:56.134
MATT: 19.

01:50:56.134 --> 01:51:01.810
SAM: You know at shop.geekandsundry.com, there's a
lot of new items up for sale.

01:51:01.810 --> 01:51:02.942
MARISHA: That's true.

01:51:02.942 --> 01:51:04.094
TALIESIN: There's the mug.

01:51:04.094 --> 01:51:06.116
LIAM: Do they have the model airship yet?

01:51:06.116 --> 01:51:07.568
SAM: There's the mug, there's rings, patches.
What?

01:51:07.568 --> 01:51:08.683
LIAM: The model airship?

01:51:08.683 --> 01:51:16.687
SAM: The model airship, it's life-sized. Nail wraps
by Espionage Cosmetics, only 12 dollars. And don't

01:51:16.687 --> 01:51:21.508
forget, one week left on pre-orders for those
silicon bracelets and the enamel pins guys.

01:51:21.508 --> 01:51:23.138
MATT: All righty.

01:51:23.138 --> 01:51:25.214
SAM: Backblaze!

01:51:25.214 --> 01:51:31.760
TALIESIN: So I'm going to show him the gun, and
I'm going to say, what do you think? And I'm going

01:51:31.760 --> 01:51:33.307
to show him where the enchantment is.

01:51:33.307 --> 01:51:35.164
SAM: You're showing him the gun? We just said
don't show people the gun.

01:51:35.164 --> 01:51:36.853
LAURA: We need to remove the enchantment from it.

01:51:36.853 --> 01:51:37.670
SAM: Okay.

01:51:37.670 --> 01:51:41.719
LAURA: If we can remove the enchantment, if it
takes a long time to transfer, maybe you can keep

01:51:41.719 --> 01:51:44.253
transferring it after we've left? Is that a
thing?

01:51:44.253 --> 01:51:52.631
MATT: "I can get rid of the enchantment
immediately, but it's gone. Transfer, that's a

01:51:52.631 --> 01:51:58.785
"time-taking process, it's much more expensive than
what I was promised as part of this contract."

01:51:58.785 --> 01:52:04.084
Looks back to Treev. Treev's leaning back and he's
like, "I just brought you here to talk with them."

01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:13.115
TALIESIN: We just want to know our options, sir, and time is
sadly of the essence. What can you tell us about this?

01:52:13.115 --> 01:52:19.275
MATT: "Strange construction."

01:52:19.275 --> 01:52:21.544
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:52:21.544 --> 01:52:33.404
MATT: "Ah. I see what you're talking about." He
starts glancing-- shut up!-- Glancing at the

01:52:33.404 --> 01:52:47.176
bottom of Retort. "It is a variation on a scrying
enchantment, with a hint of a message-type base.

01:52:47.176 --> 01:52:50.074
"It's audio only, not visual."

01:52:50.074 --> 01:52:52.065
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:54.727
TALIESIN: Can they track where we are?

01:52:54.727 --> 01:53:04.139
MATT: "They cannot track location, but this is a
joint enchantment, there are two pieces to this.

01:53:04.139 --> 01:53:11.892
"And it would appear that, wherever the receiving
end is, they can probably hear everything around it."

01:53:11.892 --> 01:53:16.674
MARISHA: Guys, this could be a gift, think of the
possibilities.

01:53:16.674 --> 01:53:18.284
TRAVIS: She's hearing this right now.

01:53:18.284 --> 01:53:19.442
SAM: If she's listening.

01:53:19.442 --> 01:53:23.454
MATT: "Oh, I'm sure whoever has the other side of
this enchantment is now well aware of everything

01:53:23.454 --> 01:53:24.910
"we've just discussed."

01:53:24.910 --> 01:53:26.044
LAURA: Great.

01:53:26.044 --> 01:53:27.392
SAM: Maybe we should take it out of the room.

01:53:27.392 --> 01:53:28.725
TALIESIN: Shh, no.

01:53:28.725 --> 01:53:32.995
MATT: "Who has the other side of this enchantment
by the way?" And he suddenly looks extremely

01:53:32.995 --> 01:53:35.877
nervous. Beads of sweat start showing up on his
forehead.

01:53:35.877 --> 01:53:42.980
TALIESIN: I'll tell you what. You do the work
quickly, you do the work well, and you follow a

01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:47.550
few other instructions of ours, and I will not say
her name out loud right now. How does that sound

01:53:47.550 --> 01:53:48.751
to you?

01:53:48.751 --> 01:53:52.728
MATT: What do you want? Disenchantment,
transference, tell me.

01:53:52.728 --> 01:54:01.179
TALIESIN: Not anymore, we just want the
enchantment destroyed. And I will not say her

01:54:01.179 --> 01:54:05.576
name, so that she will know that you do not know
who she is.

01:54:05.576 --> 01:54:09.107
MATT: What does that mean? What does that mean?
What's he saying? What is he saying?

01:54:09.107 --> 01:54:10.660
SAM: For your own protection.

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:19.236
TALIESIN: This is me, giving you a deal, good sir.
This is me, showing you respect. And you, if you

01:54:19.236 --> 01:54:27.346
can hear me, and I get the sneaking suspicion you
can, I'm not ignoring you anymore.

01:54:27.346 --> 01:54:40.042
SAM: Wait, before you do, a quick word, is there a
way to reverse the direction? Okay.

01:54:40.042 --> 01:54:50.374
MATT: Reaches into a little pouch of components on
the side. Takes things, crushes them, sprinkles

01:54:50.374 --> 01:54:57.728
them on. Looks about. "Ahem, it's done, it's gone,
here."

01:54:57.728 --> 01:55:00.289
LAURA: What?! Really?

01:55:00.289 --> 01:55:02.047
MARISHA: Can I check it?

01:55:02.047 --> 01:55:02.941
MATT: Yeah.

01:55:02.941 --> 01:55:04.246
MARISHA: Scanlan, help me check this.

01:55:04.246 --> 01:55:05.247
LAURA: That fast?

01:55:05.247 --> 01:55:06.147
SAM: All right.

01:55:06.147 --> 01:55:07.669
LAURA: You are very powerful, you.

01:55:07.669 --> 01:55:10.243
MARISHA: What do we do here?

01:55:10.243 --> 01:55:11.715
MATT: Make an arcana check.

01:55:11.715 --> 01:55:12.702
MARISHA: Scanlan, help.

01:55:12.702 --> 01:55:15.709
SAM: Yeah, I got a natural one, sister.

01:55:15.709 --> 01:55:17.632
MARISHA: Oh boy. 16.

01:55:17.632 --> 01:55:25.050
MATT: As you're staring at it, you watch as the
Ripley signature that's very, very small, put in

01:55:25.050 --> 01:55:30.807
the bottom of the piece of whitestone, begins to
glow. Suddenly, he goes, "By the way, it takes a

01:55:30.807 --> 01:55:38.919
"moment. Put your face away please!" And as you
pull it back, it flashes, and then goes dark

01:55:38.919 --> 01:55:42.670
again. "And... now it's done."

01:55:42.670 --> 01:55:45.990
MARISHA: Okay, I'll look at it again. What does it
look like?

01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:47.346
MATT: Looks the same.

01:55:47.346 --> 01:55:48.750
MARISHA: What do you mean it looks the same?

01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:53.182
MATT: Meaning like, the signature's still there,
the stone is still there, but that slight essence

01:55:53.182 --> 01:55:55.979
of slight enchantment that was there before is
gone.

01:55:55.979 --> 01:56:01.442
TALIESIN: You wouldn't happen to know where to get
some construction materials on very quick notice?

01:56:01.442 --> 01:56:04.760
MATT: "No!"

01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:06.847
LAURA: You wouldn't be able to identify something
for me, would you?

01:56:06.847 --> 01:56:08.584
TALIESIN: Oh yes, go ahead, do that.

01:56:08.584 --> 01:56:11.104
LAURA: You seem so smart, is all.

01:56:11.104 --> 01:56:14.376
MATT: "This was not part of the agreement."

01:56:14.376 --> 01:56:17.133
LAURA: Darling, we're already here, please?

01:56:17.133 --> 01:56:18.702
TALIESIN: And we didn't say your name.

01:56:18.702 --> 01:56:20.022
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

01:56:20.022 --> 01:56:21.505
MARISHA: "And we didn't say your name."

01:56:21.505 --> 01:56:26.157
LAURA: Oh, damn it. I will pay you.

01:56:26.157 --> 01:56:29.630
MATT: "How much?"

01:56:29.630 --> 01:56:31.928
LAURA: How much do you want?

01:56:31.928 --> 01:56:36.661
MATT: Looks back at Treev. Treev goes--

01:56:36.661 --> 01:56:38.583
LAURA: Just to identify something, that's all
dear.

01:56:38.583 --> 01:56:39.758
TALIESIN: Something simple.

01:56:39.758 --> 01:56:42.504
MATT: "100 gold, please."

01:56:42.504 --> 01:56:52.731
LAURA: 100 gold. Darling. It seemed effortless for
you to do that before. Is it hard?

01:56:52.731 --> 01:56:54.679
MATT: "I have a shop to get back to. I'm sorry, I
can't be here any longer."

01:56:54.679 --> 01:56:55.747
LAURA: Fine, fine.

01:56:55.747 --> 01:56:56.860
MATT: And he gets up from the stool.

01:56:56.860 --> 01:57:01.646
LAURA: Shit! Fine. A hundred gold, whatever. I
just want to know, can you look at this please?

01:57:01.646 --> 01:57:08.255
It's a tea set, it's gold. Isn't it beautiful?

01:57:08.255 --> 01:57:13.972
MATT: Takes it from you and his hands are clammy,
as he pulls it out of your grasp. And he looks

01:57:13.972 --> 01:57:18.417
over the tea set, and it's in his hands, he
doesn't really know what to do with it. And he

01:57:18.417 --> 01:57:29.680
places it on the side. "Okay." Begins breathing
heavily, and it's fogging the side of the metallic

01:57:29.680 --> 01:57:34.079
tea set. And you see this sweat dripping off of
his nose. He's still very nervous about this

01:57:34.079 --> 01:57:42.573
endeavor and wants to get out of here as soon as
possible. "All right, this is a tea set of

01:57:42.573 --> 01:57:50.501
"envenoming. Whenever you produce some sort of a
liquid imbibement within the tea set, it's

01:57:50.501 --> 01:57:54.041
"guaranteed to be a bad day for whoever drinks from
it."

01:57:54.041 --> 01:57:56.111
LAURA: It's so good we didn't drink from it.

01:57:56.111 --> 01:57:59.929
TALIESIN: Does the liquid hold its potency or is
it just within the tea set?

01:57:59.929 --> 01:58:01.069
MATT: "For a day."

01:58:01.069 --> 01:58:02.109
TALIESIN: Good to know.

01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.939
LAURA: Lovely.

01:58:02.939 --> 01:58:03.696
TALIESIN: Excellent.

01:58:03.696 --> 01:58:04.845
SAM: Will someone die?

01:58:04.845 --> 01:58:09.107
MATT: "I'm not a master of poisons, I just know
that it poisons."

01:58:09.107 --> 01:58:10.571
LAURA: Thank you so much.

01:58:10.571 --> 01:58:14.656
MATT: And he takes it and holds it, and is like,
"100 gold."

01:58:14.656 --> 01:58:16.101
LAURA: Of course dear.

01:58:16.101 --> 01:58:21.376
MATT: "Thank you." And as soon as he gets it, he
lets go of it, puts it in his pouch. "And good

01:58:21.376 --> 01:58:29.783
"day. Treev, careful next time." And he darts off,
outside. Bursting through the door and into the

01:58:29.783 --> 01:58:32.312
alley. And Treev sits.

01:58:32.312 --> 01:58:37.617
TALIESIN: I was imagining the FBI agent from The
Frighteners, I was having a lot of that.

01:58:37.617 --> 01:58:42.251
MARISHA: I was imagining The Creep music video from
Lonely Island.

01:58:42.251 --> 01:58:54.058
MATT: Kind of. Yeah, actually. Treev is like, "Now
that was fun to watch."

01:58:54.058 --> 01:58:55.278
LAURA: That guy was weird.

01:58:55.278 --> 01:59:00.616
MATT: "He's a weird one. I knew he'd do the job,
but honestly I like watching him twitch."

01:59:00.616 --> 01:59:08.839
TALIESIN: Thank you, that was very helpful. That
was very helpful. They don't know that we're

01:59:08.839 --> 01:59:13.329
coming as they don't know how we're going or why,
because we have spoken all of that outside of the

01:59:13.329 --> 01:59:15.920
range of that device. They don't know any of
that.

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:17.413
MARISHA: True, the gun was in the other room.

01:59:17.413 --> 01:59:21.863
TALIESIN: All they know is that we found the
enchantment and killed it.

01:59:21.863 --> 01:59:23.257
LIAM: Should we melt it just in case?

01:59:23.257 --> 01:59:37.041
TALIESIN: No. There will be no more melting of my
property for a little while yet. I have a bit of a

01:59:37.041 --> 01:59:44.110
quick shopping list before we head out of town. I
was wondering if it would be possible to gather

01:59:44.110 --> 01:59:48.821
some quick supplies, if some of your people knew
where to get simple construction materials,

01:59:48.821 --> 01:59:50.369
quickly. Today.

01:59:50.369 --> 01:59:52.241
LAURA: And potions of healing.

01:59:52.241 --> 01:59:58.658
MATT: "Potions, head to the Suncut Bazaar. I'm
sure you could find a few folks. We usually get ours

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:02.665
"from--" And he starts looking through a list, he
goes, "Let's see, there's--"

02:00:02.665 --> 02:00:05.163
LIAM: Are we staying here for the night before
heading out in the morning?

02:00:05.163 --> 02:00:06.103
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: No.

02:00:06.103 --> 02:00:07.153
LIAM: So we're sleeping on the ship?

02:00:07.153 --> 02:00:08.190
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yes.

02:00:08.190 --> 02:00:10.649
MATT: "Nisaba are the two I know of, at least."

02:00:10.649 --> 02:00:11.846
LAURA: Saaba and what?

02:00:11.846 --> 02:00:14.290
MATT: "Usar and Nisaba."

02:00:14.290 --> 02:00:18.853
LAURA: They'll give a good deal?

02:00:18.853 --> 02:00:22.115
MATT: "Perhaps. You ask them nicely."

02:00:22.115 --> 02:00:31.632
TALIESIN: I need lumber, steel, lead, and a couple
other things. Very simple. Just some materials.

02:00:31.632 --> 02:00:35.460
I'll show you what I'm building and I'll have you
figure out the number.

02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:38.888
MATT: "Right."

02:00:38.888 --> 02:00:43.185
TALIESIN: Loaded straight on the ship.

02:00:43.185 --> 02:00:49.795
MATT: "What you're looking for is the Bone Garden.
It's the northernmost side of the Suncut Bazaar.

02:00:49.795 --> 02:00:59.043
"They deal with a lot of the not guild-run sales
of various construction means. More for the

02:00:59.043 --> 02:01:01.188
"residential folk here in Ank'Harel."

02:01:01.188 --> 02:01:02.584
TALIESIN: That'll do.

02:01:02.584 --> 02:01:08.842
MATT: For the sake of brevity, what are you
searching for?

02:01:08.842 --> 02:01:19.847
TALIESIN: I'm trying to get enough construction
material to build a very basic 125-pound mountable

02:01:19.847 --> 02:01:25.736
cannon that I can move around the ship on wheels,
and a little bit of shot for a cannon, about five

02:01:25.736 --> 02:01:30.685
pound shot. It's simple, but it's going to be a
son of a bitch.

02:01:30.685 --> 02:01:35.508
MATT: There are cannons made. That technology--

02:01:35.508 --> 02:01:41.241
TALIESIN: --does exist. But does something that
small that can move around a ship exist? This

02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:46.688
would be something that four people could pick up
and move around.

02:01:46.688 --> 02:01:59.876
MATT: That small? The few things they have here,
they're magically-based fire. It's similar to the

02:01:59.876 --> 02:02:09.956
dragon arbalist installation. It's not so much a
gunpowder-based explosion, since that is mostly

02:02:09.956 --> 02:02:17.977
unutilized. This is a metal tube that contains an
enchantment that throws out bursts of energy. You

02:02:17.977 --> 02:02:21.440
could purchase a base for one of those
constructs. That would cut down the time

02:02:21.479 --> 02:02:26.557
because if you're going to make a cannon, that's
going to be an endeavor, that'll take you a long time.

02:02:26.557 --> 02:02:32.739
TALIESIN: A base will do, and I need to build a
thing to build cannonballs.

02:02:32.739 --> 02:02:40.697
MATT: Takes you the better part of the day to even
find out, asking around because Treev doesn't know

02:02:40.697 --> 02:02:45.742
anything about where to find the base for a cannon
like that. Takes you the better part of the rest

02:02:45.742 --> 02:02:49.873
of the day, pushing into dusk, for you to find out where
that could be purchased. That's going to run you

02:02:49.908 --> 02:02:52.486
about 60 gold.

02:02:52.486 --> 02:02:54.724
TALIESIN: I'm good with that.

02:02:54.724 --> 02:02:56.222
MATT: It's not enchanted.

02:02:56.222 --> 02:03:04.701
TALIESIN: 60 gold and then a little extra to make
cannonballs and otherwise. Get them to deliver it

02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:08.201
to the ship and I'm sending everything to be
delivered immediately to the ship.

02:03:08.201 --> 02:03:12.236
MATT: Anything else anyone wants to prepare?

02:03:12.236 --> 02:03:14.866
LAURA: Potions. I need healing potions. Who needs
healing potions?

02:03:14.866 --> 02:03:15.790
SAM: All of us.

02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:16.763
TALIESIN: Everybody.

02:03:16.763 --> 02:03:17.877
MARISHA: Sure.

02:03:17.877 --> 02:03:23.382
MATT: On street-level sales, asking around, the
most you can acquire are probably any number of

02:03:23.382 --> 02:03:33.571
common, regular healing potions you may want.
Through conversations, at most five of the greater

02:03:33.571 --> 02:03:35.193
can be purchased.

02:03:35.193 --> 02:03:37.609
LAURA: Okay. Scanlan, can you come with me?

02:03:37.609 --> 02:03:38.912
SAM: Yes.

02:03:38.912 --> 02:03:41.594
LAURA: Can we find a Hand of Ord?

02:03:41.594 --> 02:03:46.799
MATT: Yeah, not too hard to find at all. Quick
look around, a Hand of Ord, especially here in the

02:03:46.799 --> 02:03:47.827
market.

02:03:47.827 --> 02:03:49.762
SAM: Flash the thing? What am I flashing it for?

02:03:49.762 --> 02:03:51.168
LAURA: I want to talk to him.

02:03:51.168 --> 02:03:52.537
LIAM: Get the cube out.

02:03:52.537 --> 02:03:59.616
SAM: Oi, mate. We're friends with J'mon Sa Ord.

02:03:59.616 --> 02:04:05.398
LAURA: We're not making a street deal right now.

02:04:05.398 --> 02:04:07.743
SAM: Oh! I thought everything was here.

02:04:07.743 --> 02:04:11.953
TALIESIN: This could be part of your problem here.

02:04:11.953 --> 02:04:14.758
MATT: He bends down after giving you a weird
eyebrow.

02:04:14.758 --> 02:04:16.961
SAM: I'm a normal, human man.

02:04:16.961 --> 02:04:19.692
MATT: You're still in your--

02:04:19.692 --> 02:04:21.332
SAM: I forgot to take it off.

02:04:21.332 --> 02:04:30.929
MATT: So you're a normal, human man in non-Ank'Harel
attire. Shows off the necklace. He looks at it.

02:04:30.929 --> 02:04:34.842
"How did you come about that?"

02:04:34.842 --> 02:04:40.523
LAURA: We met with J'mon Sa Ord earlier. We have
their blessing.

02:04:40.523 --> 02:04:43.294
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:04:43.294 --> 02:04:47.908
LAURA: 18.

02:04:47.908 --> 02:04:49.470
MATT: 18 total?

02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:50.418
LAURA: Yeah.

02:04:50.418 --> 02:04:54.326
MATT: He goes, "Okay, what can I be of service to
you?"

02:04:54.326 --> 02:05:00.200
LAURA: We're in need of some healing potions. I'm
assuming, as a guard of the city, you have access

02:05:00.200 --> 02:05:01.809
to quite a few?

02:05:01.809 --> 02:05:06.432
MATT: "Could probably muster a few from the
barracks, yes."

02:05:06.432 --> 02:05:10.382
LAURA: Some greater healing potions would be
wonderful.

02:05:10.382 --> 02:05:16.954
MATT: "I'll get what we can spare. We still have to
keep enough to maintain our watch."

02:05:16.954 --> 02:05:18.876
LAURA: Of course.

02:05:18.876 --> 02:05:21.776
MATT: "Wait here. Give me a half-hour."

02:05:21.776 --> 02:05:23.629
SAM: Okay.

02:05:23.629 --> 02:05:28.627
MATT: You guys wait for him and he comes back with
six regular healing potions and three greater.

02:05:28.627 --> 02:05:34.960
SAM: This thing is the best thing ever! I'm not
holding anything but it's still cool!

02:05:34.960 --> 02:05:37.245
(laughter)

02:05:37.245 --> 02:05:39.398
LAURA: Six regular?

02:05:39.398 --> 02:05:42.264
TRAVIS: And three greater.

02:05:42.264 --> 02:05:47.002
MATT: "This is what we can spare from the nearby
barracks."

02:05:47.002 --> 02:05:50.205
LAURA: Thank you so much. Your aid is
appreciated.

02:05:50.205 --> 02:05:54.308
MATT: "If I could have your names, just to be safe
that everything is--"

02:05:54.308 --> 02:05:56.975
LAURA: Be pleased. Vox Machina.

02:05:56.975 --> 02:05:59.127
MATT: "Vox Machina."

02:05:59.127 --> 02:06:06.640
LAURA: And then I want to buy like three more
greaters.

02:06:06.640 --> 02:06:08.394
MATT: All right. That is 1500 gold.

02:06:08.394 --> 02:06:10.566
LAURA: Can I say I haggled?

02:06:10.566 --> 02:06:12.798
MATT: Roll a persuasion check.

02:06:12.798 --> 02:06:18.275
(assorted muttering)

02:06:18.275 --> 02:06:19.637
LAURA: Shut up!

02:06:19.637 --> 02:06:20.666
MARISHA: Big money, no whammies.

02:06:20.666 --> 02:06:21.769
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:06:21.769 --> 02:06:22.998
ALL: Oh!

02:06:22.998 --> 02:06:25.358
TRAVIS: The sorcery is strong with this one,
apparently.

02:06:25.358 --> 02:06:31.779
MATT: Through diving between two different
locations that sell these potions and forcing them

02:06:31.779 --> 02:06:37.583
to basically bid back and forth for your business,
you manage to work it down to 1100 gold pieces for

02:06:37.583 --> 02:06:39.581
the three greater healing potions.

02:06:39.581 --> 02:06:43.509
TALIESIN: It's like you've got Amazon.com on your
phone and you're going, "Eh? Eh?"

02:06:43.509 --> 02:06:46.123
LAURA: All right, three more greater healing
potions.

02:06:46.123 --> 02:06:47.046
MATT: Yes.

02:06:47.046 --> 02:06:48.034
LAURA: Sounds good.

02:06:48.034 --> 02:06:53.790
SAM: You saved 400 gold! Want to kick some of that
to this guy? Well, I've been helping you all day,

02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:56.165
shuttling back and forth between those two.

02:06:56.165 --> 02:06:57.833
LAURA: Can I insight check him?

02:06:57.833 --> 02:06:59.020
MATT: Go for it.

02:06:59.020 --> 02:07:01.745
TALIESIN: It's not going to work but oh, I hope it
does.

02:07:01.745 --> 02:07:02.966
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:07:02.966 --> 02:07:04.320
LIAM: Oh, it's high.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.130
TRAVIS: (chuckles) You're fucked.

02:07:06.130 --> 02:07:07.372
SAM: It's not that good.

02:07:07.372 --> 02:07:08.406
LAURA: 27.

02:07:08.406 --> 02:07:10.782
MATT: Remember, you can also add your own
inspiration die if you want to.

02:07:10.782 --> 02:07:15.321
SAM: No, no need. Let's see here. You said 27?

02:07:15.321 --> 02:07:16.330
LAURA: Yeah.

02:07:16.330 --> 02:07:17.377
SAM: 26.

02:07:17.377 --> 02:07:18.776
(gasping)

02:07:18.776 --> 02:07:26.223
MATT: For the first time, you see a crack in
Scanlan Shorthalt's veneer. You see a bit of sweat

02:07:26.223 --> 02:07:33.176
at his brow and as he mentions this money,
suddenly you see this quiver to his smile. His

02:07:33.176 --> 02:07:41.098
teeth shine not as bright as you recall. And there's a
taste of desperation you never knew was there at

02:07:41.098 --> 02:07:42.289
the mention of money.

02:07:42.289 --> 02:07:43.778
TRAVIS: The faintest nosebleed.

02:07:43.778 --> 02:07:44.822
LAURA: Darling?

02:07:44.822 --> 02:07:45.992
SAM: (strained) Yes?

02:07:45.992 --> 02:07:48.843
LAURA: We all have off days.

02:07:48.843 --> 02:07:51.926
SAM: (strained) I've had a whole off city!

02:07:51.926 --> 02:07:54.399
LAURA: We're about to leave.

02:07:54.399 --> 02:07:56.577
SAM: (strained) Please, can we?

02:07:56.577 --> 02:07:59.254
LAURA: We can. I won't tell anyone.

02:07:59.254 --> 02:08:02.299
SAM: All right. So, like, 200 gold then?

02:08:02.299 --> 02:08:04.461
TRAVIS: Please, sir?

02:08:04.461 --> 02:08:08.284
LAURA: I give him 50. That's for lying to me.

02:08:08.284 --> 02:08:12.632
SAM: Thank you. I want to go away from this
place.

02:08:12.632 --> 02:08:18.861
LIAM: Can we get back to politics, please?

02:08:18.861 --> 02:08:23.377
LAURA: All right. Minus 1100.

02:08:23.377 --> 02:08:31.077
MATT: I like to imagine when this whole campaign's
over, Scanlan Shorthalt comes back and cleans out

02:08:31.077 --> 02:08:32.905
the casino in vengeance.

02:08:32.905 --> 02:08:35.148
LIAM: As the airship bears down on Ank'Harel.

02:08:35.148 --> 02:08:39.644
MATT: I meant monetarily, but that works too.

02:08:39.644 --> 02:08:41.486
LIAM: Scarface.

02:08:41.486 --> 02:08:44.404
TRAVIS: Even though it's dusk, should we mount up
tonight?

02:08:44.404 --> 02:08:46.285
SAM: Yes.

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:48.101
LAURA: Yes, Let's go get on the boat.

02:08:48.101 --> 02:08:49.812
TRAVIS: Let's head to the skies.

02:08:49.812 --> 02:08:51.658
LIAM: This is really happening.

02:08:51.658 --> 02:08:53.000
TALIESIN: I'm so excited.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:54.477
LIAM: We've joked about it for ages.

02:08:54.477 --> 02:08:55.599
TRAVIS: (singing) Indalla!

02:08:55.599 --> 02:09:01.631
MATT: All right, you all make your way to the sky
port.

02:09:01.631 --> 02:09:02.807
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:09:02.807 --> 02:09:06.115
SAM: Ah, it would've been so much sweeter if we
could've stolen the airship, but getting it for

02:09:06.115 --> 02:09:07.349
free feels right.

02:09:07.349 --> 02:09:09.132
TALIESIN: We got it for a steal.

02:09:09.132 --> 02:09:16.018
MATT: All right, so you guys make your way up to
the terraced platform above the sky port. The

02:09:16.018 --> 02:09:19.704
larger ship you guys saw earlier is no longer
there, it has taken off, and now all you see

02:09:19.704 --> 02:09:25.774
before you is the ship Deera that is currently
down. The six chains have been reduced to two, and

02:09:25.774 --> 02:09:31.995
it appears to be at the ready. As opposed to its
resting position, now the fan on the sides is

02:09:31.995 --> 02:09:39.502
unfurled, the crystals themselves glow with a
faint blue energy signature, as the dusk sun

02:09:39.502 --> 02:09:46.707
begins to set. It's much more prominent now. And a
series of four rope ladders have been dropped from the

02:09:46.707 --> 02:09:50.029
side of the actual ship.

02:09:50.029 --> 02:09:52.633
SAM: Ladies, your chariot awaits.

02:09:52.633 --> 02:09:56.767
MARISHA: No. I make sure Scanlan goes first.

02:09:56.767 --> 02:09:58.179
SAM: All right.

02:09:58.179 --> 02:10:01.227
MATT: All right.

02:10:01.227 --> 02:10:04.156
LAURA: I turn around and wink at him as I go up.

02:10:04.156 --> 02:10:09.497
MATT: All right, you guys make your way up the
rope ladders. This is indeed the ship that you

02:10:09.497 --> 02:10:15.667
made across, although it has a new paint job on
it. It looks a little bit nicer, but it also seems

02:10:15.667 --> 02:10:21.992
to have seen some disuse. You make your way onto
the board and there you can see familiar ship

02:10:21.992 --> 02:10:27.277
hands that go around, nodding to you out of
recognition. Some of them are pulling up the rope

02:10:27.277 --> 02:10:32.235
ladders behind you. You see two on the bottom
there are now unchaining from the edge of where

02:10:32.235 --> 02:10:36.494
it's latched onto the side of the ship, on each
side, that keeps it latched into the skyport. And

02:10:36.494 --> 02:10:42.520
Captain Damon comes up to the top to greet you.
"Very well. I see that you've come to begin the

02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:48.738
"journey. Well, it is a pleasure to see you all
again, safe and sound, although you are missing

02:10:48.738 --> 02:10:51.279
"one. Two, actually."

02:10:51.279 --> 02:11:00.220
TALIESIN: Yes, we're a bit thinner. It has been
difficult and we have friends elsewhere preparing

02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:05.189
for more difficult times. Are you aware of what's
going on across the sea?

02:11:05.189 --> 02:11:11.662
MATT: "I'm very aware. That was the guild that
owned the ship and ran our business disappeared in

02:11:11.662 --> 02:11:18.216
"the attack, and we've been set adrift, making our
own money and making ends meet in the meantime,

02:11:18.216 --> 02:11:19.940
"doing odd jobs here and there."

02:11:19.940 --> 02:11:25.139
TALIESIN: Well, if you're interested, we are
definitely moving towards correcting some of these

02:11:25.139 --> 02:11:27.579
problems. Quickly.

02:11:27.579 --> 02:11:34.946
MATT: "If you do, tell the guild that the ship
crashed, because as of right now it's technically

02:11:34.946 --> 02:11:36.376
"my ship."

02:11:36.376 --> 02:11:38.136
TALIESIN: Is this an insurance thing?

02:11:38.136 --> 02:11:42.285
MATT: "I didn't-- the guild owned and ran the
shipping business, but I mean--"

02:11:42.285 --> 02:11:48.118
TALIESIN: Oh no. Yes, I'm a deep believer in
insurance fraud. Of course.

02:11:48.118 --> 02:11:51.015
MATT: "It's not--" (sighs)

02:11:51.015 --> 02:11:53.487
LIAM: We're friends here. You're good.

02:11:53.487 --> 02:11:59.817
MATT: "I'd like to know where we're going. As that
is part of the deal to be kept secret until boarding."

02:11:59.817 --> 02:12:04.432
TRAVIS: Actually, if you don't mind, we're heading
north. Once we're away from port, we plan to

02:12:04.432 --> 02:12:06.594
inform you of our destination.

02:12:06.594 --> 02:12:07.553
TALIESIN: Tomorrow.

02:12:07.553 --> 02:12:11.455
MATT: "North it is. Very well." And he pulls a
whistle from around his neck and blows it really

02:12:11.455 --> 02:12:16.576
loudly and everyone unleashes the chains from the
side. (clanking sound) They crash down, slamming

02:12:16.576 --> 02:12:22.250
onto the terrace deck below. The ship lurches and
lifts up a few feet naturally and finding its own

02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:27.193
balance, based on the enchantment of the crystals.
"You can stay on the edge if you'd like. You're

02:12:27.193 --> 02:12:36.730
"welcome to find your quarters down below. But we
are about to make sail." He walks to the edge of

02:12:36.730 --> 02:12:42.248
the ship, the middle of the ship, the back where
you can see he directs the position of it, and

02:12:42.248 --> 02:12:49.520
controls the crystals themselves. And the giant
dragon-headed arbalist you see installed at the

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:57.601
side. They're like the giant heavy crossbows that
are bolted onto the side, these large spears-- the

02:12:57.601 --> 02:13:01.120
ones you were using in the fight before, they're
nearly twice the size of what they were, and the

02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:07.859
front of them have this giant dark metal dragon
head that is built around it. It's been definitely

02:13:07.859 --> 02:13:15.449
fitted to be a much more badass airship than you
remember. It lifts up, and as the last bit of the

02:13:15.449 --> 02:13:22.025
sun disappears below the distant horizon and the
city of Ank'Harel's lighting up for the evening

02:13:22.025 --> 02:13:28.952
time, you take up into the sky, slowly turning
northward towards what you can see as barely

02:13:28.952 --> 02:13:37.311
visible, the silhouetted edge of the mountain range
before you, the Agrad Mountains, making your way

02:13:37.311 --> 02:13:41.064
to the rest of your journey. And we're going to go
ahead and take a break; we'll come back here in

02:13:41.064 --> 02:13:42.199
just a minute.

02:13:42.199 --> 02:13:47.077
TRAVIS: One thing before we do: we forgot to
mention that next week during Game the Game,

02:13:47.077 --> 02:13:53.836
thanks to Magic Puzzle Quest, Matt and Marisha,
Taliesin, Liam, and myself will be joining Ivan

02:13:53.836 --> 02:13:57.942
and Becca for Game the Game, from 5:30 to 6:30, so
make sure you tune in. It's going to be a very

02:13:57.942 --> 02:14:00.070
special Game the Game. Thank you, Magic Puzzle
Quest.

02:14:00.070 --> 02:14:01.725
LAURA: Also thank you Backblaze!

02:14:01.725 --> 02:14:06.995
MATT: All right guys, we'll see you in a few
minutes. Thank you, Travis.

02:14:06.995 --> 02:27:05.154
[break]

02:27:05.154 --> 02:27:11.023
MATT: Hello, and welcome back to Critical Role. So
as we left off, Vox Machina is--

02:27:11.023 --> 02:27:17.525
LAURA: Wait, before we do that! We forgot to
mention at the top of the show. There's only one

02:27:17.525 --> 02:27:20.720
week of preorder left on the bracelets and the
pins.

02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:22.627
TRAVIS: Yeah, we wouldn't want people to miss out.
It's limited run.

02:27:22.627 --> 02:27:25.050
TALIESIN: I don't have a bracelet, but I have the
pins.

02:27:25.050 --> 02:27:26.311
LAURA: He's wearing the bracelet.

02:27:26.311 --> 02:27:30.146
SAM: Laura, I did mention that while you were
getting whispered to.

02:27:30.146 --> 02:27:36.829
LAURA: I know, you did. I heard you, but, you
know. In case people were drowning you out. And

02:27:36.829 --> 02:27:41.517
then we also have the limited items, which we only
have a little bit left in the store: the nail

02:27:41.517 --> 02:27:49.822
wraps, and the patches that were limited edition
at Comic-Con that are still there. I

02:27:49.822 --> 02:27:51.996
think, still in the store? So yeah.

02:27:51.996 --> 02:27:53.562
TALIESIN: Were the rings up in there?

02:27:53.562 --> 02:27:55.498
LAURA: The rings! And the rings, the spinning
rings.

02:27:55.498 --> 02:27:56.936
TALIESIN: Did they come back in?

02:27:56.936 --> 02:27:59.144
TRAVIS: And the mug, which is my favorite. Okay,
now we're good.

02:27:59.144 --> 02:28:00.280
LAURA: Okay, sorry.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:06.849
MATT: All right, no worries. Thank you for
mentioning that. Vox Machina, as night has taken

02:28:06.849 --> 02:28:14.176
the sky and you lift up, heading northward, you
watch as the glowing jewel of Ank'Harel begins to

02:28:14.176 --> 02:28:21.007
slowly grow smaller and smaller in the distance.
Below you, you see a mass of black darkness.

02:28:21.007 --> 02:28:23.954
MARISHA: I want to take Percy to the front of the
ship.

02:28:23.954 --> 02:28:24.949
TALIESIN: Ah! That's my--

02:28:24.949 --> 02:28:26.135
MARISHA: Set it down.

02:28:26.135 --> 02:28:27.320
TALIESIN: I'll put it down, okay.

02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:30.727
MARISHA: And I want to--

02:28:30.727 --> 02:28:32.404
TALIESIN: (whispers) I feel so dirty.

02:28:32.404 --> 02:28:33.799
MARISHA: (whispers) Say you can fly.

02:28:33.799 --> 02:28:34.627
TALIESIN: No.

02:28:34.627 --> 02:28:35.524
MARISHA: Say you can fly.

02:28:35.524 --> 02:28:38.613
TALIESIN: No, because I'm not going to say that--
It's not true. It's not true.

02:28:38.613 --> 02:28:39.640
MARISHA: Say you're flying.

02:28:39.640 --> 02:28:40.835
TALIESIN: I feel sick.

02:28:40.835 --> 02:28:43.064
MARISHA: (laughs) Damn it.

02:28:43.064 --> 02:28:44.652
LAURA: Don't throw up again.

02:28:44.652 --> 02:28:48.756
LIAM: While they're doing that, I'm actually
flying next to the ship and praying for a while

02:28:48.756 --> 02:28:50.604
out in the dark.

02:28:50.604 --> 02:29:01.952
MATT: Okay. So yeah. You have very little idea of
where you are other than watching the city slowly

02:29:01.952 --> 02:29:06.441
disappear. Above, as you look towards the front
of the ship, where it's going, you can see little

02:29:06.441 --> 02:29:12.235
specks of light in the distance, almost like
smaller cities or villages that slowly begin to

02:29:12.235 --> 02:29:18.365
move past and below you. And the stars in the sky
breaking through some of the clouds that

02:29:18.365 --> 02:29:24.861
occasionally block as you progress. As the ship
begins to rise about cloud level, you can see the

02:29:24.861 --> 02:29:30.349
very faint outline of the mountain range, and you
then coast above it. As you begin to finally crest

02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:37.948
over the top of the mountain range itself, Captain
Damon locks the ship steering mechanism in place

02:29:37.948 --> 02:29:45.934
and walks back to address all of you, and goes,
"All right, we're well on our way. We're heading

02:29:45.934 --> 02:29:50.484
"north. We've been travelling for a number of hours
now. Where are we going?"

02:29:50.484 --> 02:29:52.686
TALIESIN: Before--

02:29:52.686 --> 02:29:55.710
MATT: (sighs)

02:29:55.710 --> 02:30:00.018
TALIESIN: I swear this is important. Before we say
anything, we would like to take a moment to meet

02:30:00.018 --> 02:30:01.638
the rest of the crew.

02:30:01.638 --> 02:30:03.822
TRAVIS: Yes, and all hands on deck.

02:30:03.822 --> 02:30:08.023
TALIESIN: To make sure that nobody suspicious has
snuck on board and nobody is hiding their

02:30:08.023 --> 02:30:09.197
identity.

02:30:09.197 --> 02:30:20.916
MATT: "Very well." He gathers the rest of the
crew. You recognize a few of them. They have a few

02:30:20.916 --> 02:30:29.381
new faces, because they lost a few on the last
journey. You individually meet each one with

02:30:29.381 --> 02:30:35.962
pretty heavy inspection from you guys. I want you
to make insight checks, all of you, as you're

02:30:35.962 --> 02:30:37.857
inspecting this crew.

02:30:37.857 --> 02:30:41.319
TALIESIN: No!

02:30:41.319 --> 02:30:43.791
SAM: 15.

02:30:43.791 --> 02:30:45.239
TRAVIS: 19.

02:30:45.239 --> 02:30:46.843
LAURA: 22.

02:30:46.843 --> 02:30:47.969
LIAM: 15.

02:30:47.969 --> 02:31:01.497
MATT: All right. Glancing about, mostly human
crew. There is one elf, a female, who's part of

02:31:01.497 --> 02:31:09.117
the crew, who handles most direct navigation with
the captain now, and you hadn't met before. Her

02:31:09.117 --> 02:31:19.385
name is Julia, and she seems nice enough. There is
a female halfling who has very nice, clean-cut

02:31:19.385 --> 02:31:26.826
hair, pulled into a heavy ponytail in the back.
And as she smiles, you can see her somewhat broken

02:31:26.826 --> 02:31:39.788
and rotted teeth. As you guys give the whole
look-over, she smiles and looks a little nervous

02:31:39.788 --> 02:31:48.668
at the rest of you. You take a closer look and you
pick up on it, Vex. This is one of the bandits,

02:31:48.668 --> 02:31:51.311
the one you took captive on the journey over to
Vasselheim.

02:31:51.311 --> 02:31:52.926
LAURA: The one that I harpooned!

02:31:52.926 --> 02:31:55.591
MATT: Yes. She apparently has become one of the
crew now.

02:31:55.591 --> 02:31:58.896
LAURA: Wow. Well, we vouched for her at the time.

02:31:58.896 --> 02:32:01.075
MARISHA: We wanted her, right? Are we cool?

02:32:01.075 --> 02:32:04.723
TRAVIS: She dies.

02:32:04.723 --> 02:32:10.173
TALIESIN: Good for you. Excellent.

02:32:10.173 --> 02:32:12.959
MARISHA: What's her name? Did we ever get a name
from her?

02:32:12.959 --> 02:32:14.105
MATT: Teela.

02:32:14.105 --> 02:32:15.896
ALL: Teela.

02:32:15.896 --> 02:32:20.535
MATT: Teera, sorry. R. Teera. I had it written
down. I should look at my sheet first.

02:32:20.535 --> 02:32:30.798
TALIESIN: And there's no magic attempts to hide
somebody's face or anything like that?

02:32:30.798 --> 02:32:36.789
MATT: No. You guys all give a good look and a very
thorough inspection of the crew, and they all seem

02:32:36.789 --> 02:32:37.902
legitimate.

02:32:37.902 --> 02:32:39.015
TALIESIN: And this is everybody?

02:32:39.015 --> 02:32:39.868
MATT: Yes.

02:32:39.868 --> 02:32:40.639
TRAVIS: Captain.

02:32:40.639 --> 02:32:41.590
MATT: "Yes?"

02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:46.777
TRAVIS: Who is it that's in charge of your
seaworthy navigations? The newest member of your

02:32:46.777 --> 02:32:48.190
crew you mentioned?

02:32:48.190 --> 02:32:54.722
MATT: "Well, that would be Teera. She's actually
been all about this ocean. Not necessarily by

02:32:54.722 --> 02:32:58.922
"skyship, but she knows the area as well, and has
since studied up and has become a very esteemed

02:32:58.922 --> 02:33:06.556
"member of our crew." He looks to her, and Teera's
smile broadens again. "That is correct. I'm happy

02:33:06.556 --> 02:33:11.324
"to help in wherever it is you're looking to go.
Where are you going?"

02:33:11.324 --> 02:33:21.154
SAM: Shall we lay it on them, then? We're going to
go near the island of glass, aka Glintshore.

02:33:21.154 --> 02:33:32.605
MATT: You watch her face go, and Captain Damon
goes, "Why Glintshore? That place is a rocky waste."

02:33:32.605 --> 02:33:37.237
SAM: Well, we're not going there. We're going near
it to find a shipwreck.

02:33:37.237 --> 02:33:45.217
MATT: "Shipwreck? There's probably hundreds of
them! The place is dotted with reefs."

02:33:45.217 --> 02:33:49.228
TALIESIN: We're looking for a ship called The
Shrew.

02:33:49.228 --> 02:33:52.655
MATT: "So you're wanting us to take you to the
Hespet Archipelago."

02:33:52.655 --> 02:33:55.457
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:55.457 --> 02:33:58.506
TALIESIN: There is another ship on the way there,
as well.

02:33:58.506 --> 02:34:00.651
TRAVIS: Some say arch-ipelago, but yeah.

02:34:00.651 --> 02:34:02.448
TALIESIN: There may be trouble.

02:34:02.448 --> 02:34:07.482
SAM: The other ship may already be there, and if
we can find the other ship, then we've found our

02:34:07.482 --> 02:34:08.754
destination.

02:34:08.754 --> 02:34:25.199
MATT: "Right. The arch-ipelago. Let's see. We have
no sundry we're holding, so we're at maximum

02:34:25.199 --> 02:34:30.851
"speed. I'd say two, maybe three days of travel,
depending on weather."

02:34:30.851 --> 02:34:36.225
SAM: Just to get in the area. It'll take us
another day or two to find this ship.

02:34:36.225 --> 02:34:42.812
TALIESIN: Well, not necessarily. Every day we scry.
Every day we hone in. We keep following where

02:34:42.812 --> 02:34:43.932
they're going.

02:34:43.932 --> 02:34:46.066
MARISHA: Ideally, she does the hard work for us.

02:34:46.066 --> 02:34:55.017
TRAVIS: It's worth noting as well that if we do
find this ship, we do not mean her well.

02:34:55.017 --> 02:34:59.013
MATT: "I can only assume, going to Hespet."

02:34:59.013 --> 02:35:04.482
MARISHA: You seem very familiar with this place.
Do you have more information?

02:35:04.482 --> 02:35:06.212
LIAM: Or apprehension?

02:35:06.212 --> 02:35:12.989
MATT: "Hespit is a-- the whole network of islands
there is a haven for criminals, fugitives,

02:35:12.989 --> 02:35:18.808
"pirates, and everyone else who generally keeps
away from the large continents. So you go without

02:35:18.808 --> 02:35:24.203
"guard, stay without threat, you're likely to be
bent into slavery, or end up left bleeding

02:35:24.203 --> 02:35:25.828
"somewhere on the shoreline."

02:35:25.828 --> 02:35:28.049
TRAVIS: Is that a promise?

02:35:28.049 --> 02:35:29.534
LAURA: We're super powerful.

02:35:29.534 --> 02:35:33.141
LIAM: You do the flying. We'll do the fucking shit
up.

02:35:33.141 --> 02:35:38.107
MATT: "We'll have to come in low, most likely. I
don't want to try and draw attention to this ship,

02:35:38.107 --> 02:35:42.659
"because I'm sure it would fetch quite a penny if
it were to fall into the hands of--"

02:35:42.659 --> 02:35:45.320
TRAVIS: I'm sure Keyleth would provide you with
some cover as well.

02:35:45.320 --> 02:35:48.747
MATT: "Well, that would be very much appreciated."

02:35:48.747 --> 02:35:50.052
MARISHA: I could do that.

02:35:50.052 --> 02:35:55.661
MATT: "Thankfully Glintshore itself is pretty much
useless to most of their standards of business

02:35:55.661 --> 02:36:02.768
"practices. It's mostly ignored by them, from what
I know at least of what they do, but still, just

02:36:02.768 --> 02:36:04.397
"to be safe and be careful."

02:36:04.397 --> 02:36:10.714
SAM: Has Teera been around there? Does she know
anything of that particular shipwreck?

02:36:10.714 --> 02:36:17.249
MATT: He's about to talk and Teera pipes up, "I
do, actually, and I will be guiding us directly to

02:36:17.249 --> 02:36:18.890
"it, so don't worry."

02:36:18.890 --> 02:36:20.089
SAM: To the shipwreck?

02:36:20.089 --> 02:36:21.993
MATT: "Not to the shipwreck, but to the
Glintshore."

02:36:21.993 --> 02:36:26.354
SAM: Have you heard of that shipwreck? The Shrew?

02:36:26.354 --> 02:36:31.948
MATT: "I have not. But there are plenty of
shipwrecks in the area. I'm sure there's much to

02:36:31.948 --> 02:36:33.849
"recover, if that's what you're looking for."

02:36:33.849 --> 02:36:37.247
LAURA: No, we'll stick with the Shrew.

02:36:37.247 --> 02:36:42.229
MATT: "I'll take you where I can."

02:36:42.229 --> 02:36:54.348
TRAVIS: The island of glass, is it called that
because of a glass production site?

02:36:54.348 --> 02:36:58.516
(laughter)

02:36:58.516 --> 02:36:59.708
SAM: Yep.

02:36:59.708 --> 02:37:01.355
LAURA: Was that hard for you, Grog?

02:37:01.355 --> 02:37:02.895
TRAVIS: I hurt myself.

02:37:02.895 --> 02:37:15.823
MATT: Captain Damon says, "I don't know the
history, exactly, but at some point in time,

02:37:15.823 --> 02:37:24.141
"something really bad happened. All the sand of the
shores were fused into dark brown and black glass.

02:37:24.141 --> 02:37:31.118
"It's a jagged landscape, leading all the way up to
the mountain. The jungle is petrified and dead.

02:37:31.118 --> 02:37:39.670
"It's not a welcoming place. I'm surprised why
anyone would pay so much to go there. But I'm sure

02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:40.953
"you have your reasons."

02:37:40.953 --> 02:37:44.009
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see if that
sounds familiar?

02:37:44.009 --> 02:37:45.847
MATT: Sure.

02:37:45.847 --> 02:37:53.386
MARISHA: Beasts or something that would happen--
Heat, a lot of fucking heat. 26.

02:37:53.440 --> 02:38:06.117
MATT: To fuse the beaches, or an island its
entirety, would require such extreme, fierce heat.

02:38:06.268 --> 02:38:09.724
This is going through your mind as well, Percy,
being a man who understands this science very

02:38:09.724 --> 02:38:18.768
well. Something very bad had to have happened here
a long time ago on a very large scale to render an

02:38:18.768 --> 02:38:21.886
island pretty much covered in glass.

02:38:21.886 --> 02:38:29.860
LAURA: Do you think this is where they knocked
Thordak down? Didn't they fight Thordak in the

02:38:29.860 --> 02:38:30.992
ocean?

02:38:30.992 --> 02:38:34.867
MARISHA: That's what my thought was. Would a
dragon's breath?

02:38:34.867 --> 02:38:40.778
MATT: A dragon's breath would fuse a small chunk
of the beach here.

02:38:40.778 --> 02:38:46.194
MARISHA: What about if a bunch of sorcerers and
magic users got together and made a big nuke?

02:38:46.194 --> 02:38:53.008
MATT: That's possible. Very little chance there
would be any survivors.

02:38:53.008 --> 02:38:56.221
LIAM: Like a meteor or a comet from the sky.

02:38:56.221 --> 02:39:04.419
TALIESIN: Even a comet wouldn't be enough. This is
big.

02:39:04.419 --> 02:39:05.862
MARISHA: Keyteor.

02:39:05.862 --> 02:39:11.687
MATT: As you guys are having this conversation, he
goes, "The mountain still stands. The jungle still

02:39:11.687 --> 02:39:16.949
"stands, though petrified and burnt. I know not the
means that brought it to where it is, but it's

02:39:16.949 --> 02:39:21.334
"been that way for as long as we have history on
it. Long ago."

02:39:21.334 --> 02:39:26.682
MARISHA: How long ago was it?

02:39:26.682 --> 02:39:32.009
MATT: "I'm assuming the Age of Arcanum if
anything."

02:39:32.009 --> 02:39:38.182
TRAVIS: Right. You said we have quarters on this
ship; do you mind if I sleep under the stars?

02:39:38.182 --> 02:39:40.635
MATT: "Be my guest."

02:39:40.635 --> 02:39:45.277
TRAVIS: Rocking. Going to commune with nature in
my own way. Fart in the wind.

02:39:45.277 --> 02:39:47.379
TALIESIN: I'm going to be far away from that.

02:39:47.379 --> 02:39:51.847
TRAVIS: No one wants to join me? Get all hippie up
on the deck of the ship?

02:39:51.847 --> 02:39:55.462
LAURA: I'll do that! I'll sleep out, and Trinket
will want to do that as well.

02:39:55.462 --> 02:39:57.237
LIAM: I actually do, yeah.

02:39:57.237 --> 02:39:58.591
MATT: (bear noises)

02:39:58.591 --> 02:40:02.179
LAURA: Stars, Trinket. Beautiful.

02:40:02.179 --> 02:40:06.423
LIAM: Speaking of heat, make with the bed farts,
Trinket. I get cold at night.

02:40:06.423 --> 02:40:15.487
SAM: Keyleth, make sure you learn your scrying
spells for tomorrow. Do we still have that ball,

02:40:15.487 --> 02:40:16.999
the scry-ball?

02:40:16.999 --> 02:40:18.061
MATT: Yep.

02:40:18.061 --> 02:40:21.005
LAURA: We'll have two scrys tomorrow if you learn
the spell.

02:40:21.005 --> 02:40:26.708
MARISHA: I could theoretically do three scrys
tomorrow. I could &lt;i&gt;theoretically&lt;/i&gt; do &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; scrys

02:40:26.708 --> 02:40:28.010
tomorrow.

02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:36.172
TRAVIS: I pay super close attention, but after we
gave them the destination, did they tell us how

02:40:36.172 --> 02:40:37.485
long it would take?

02:40:37.485 --> 02:40:39.337
SAM: Two, three days.

02:40:39.337 --> 02:40:40.696
MATT: Depending on the weather.

02:40:40.696 --> 02:40:46.703
TRAVIS: What if we pass over the ship in the
night?

02:40:46.703 --> 02:40:49.963
TALIESIN: Then we'll attack them in the night.

02:40:49.963 --> 02:40:53.821
SAM: How will we see them? Is there someone who
stands watch at night?

02:40:53.821 --> 02:40:58.514
MARISHA: She knows where we're going, so she'll
let us know if we get there?

02:40:58.514 --> 02:41:02.040
SAM: But we're looking for the boat, not the
island.

02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:05.976
TALIESIN: The boat itself. There's work that
always needs to be done. There'll be lights,

02:41:05.976 --> 02:41:08.016
unless they are hiding.

02:41:08.016 --> 02:41:12.197
LIAM: You can alert one of us if we come upon a
ship in the night or day, correct?

02:41:12.197 --> 02:41:16.576
MATT: "I have to sleep at some point as well."

02:41:16.576 --> 02:41:18.738
LIAM: Of course, but someone is awake?

02:41:18.738 --> 02:41:22.273
MATT: "Deshall, who is my second in command, will
take over while I'm sleeping. There will be

02:41:22.273 --> 02:41:26.640
"someone here, along with a few hands, taking
shifts as well at all times."

02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:33.353
MARISHA: I describe the ship to them from what
I've seen.

02:41:33.353 --> 02:41:37.362
LAURA: But it's in the ocean, isn't it? And we're
very high above it?

02:41:37.362 --> 02:41:39.907
TRAVIS: Do we want to go lower?

02:41:39.907 --> 02:41:43.697
SAM: Yes.

02:41:43.697 --> 02:41:45.809
TRAVIS: How high off the deck, would you say?

02:41:45.809 --> 02:41:55.822
SAM: Off the sea? Three, maybe four feet? No. I
don't know, couple hundred feet? You're the captain.

02:41:55.822 --> 02:42:00.596
MATT: "We're okay for now. High is fine. But once
we get close to the archipelago we'll want to make

02:42:00.596 --> 02:42:06.135
"sure that we keep within 100 feet of the
surface. I could take it into the ocean. This can

02:42:06.135 --> 02:42:08.127
"work as a functional ship in the water."

02:42:08.127 --> 02:42:13.248
TRAVIS: Shut the hell up! Well, we want to stay
out, right now.

02:42:13.248 --> 02:42:25.535
MATT: "Well then, you seem weary enough. You may
have your rest, and rest assured that we'll be to

02:42:25.535 --> 02:42:32.443
"your destination as soon as this ship can carry
us. I'm going to rest myself." He goes down to his

02:42:32.443 --> 02:42:42.205
quarters and Deshall takes over, who is
mid-thirties, grizzled, scruff on his chin, but

02:42:42.205 --> 02:42:47.818
put together well, hair parted to one side, not a
man of many words. He takes over the helm and

02:42:47.907 --> 02:42:53.679
keeps it going through the night. You guys go
ahead and rest for the evening?

02:42:53.679 --> 02:42:57.187
LIAM: I'm going to meditate for an hour before
bed.

02:42:57.187 --> 02:43:05.044
TRAVIS: Could I take a shot of the sandkheg
bottle? I would like to slowly start building up

02:43:05.044 --> 02:43:06.507
an immunity.

02:43:06.507 --> 02:43:12.011
MATT: All righty. Make a constitution saving
throw, Grog.

02:43:12.011 --> 02:43:15.116
LIAM: (Grog voice) Meaning I would like to get 
fucked up on a regular basis.

02:43:15.210 --> 02:43:16.568
TRAVIS: 29.

02:43:16.568 --> 02:43:24.443
MATT: You drink it. You feel the sparkling
numbness begin to spread across your throat. It's

02:43:24.443 --> 02:43:30.311
strange. It's weird. It's exhilarating. It
triggers your adrenaline, and you almost go into a

02:43:30.311 --> 02:43:35.453
rage from the instinctual reaction of that sort of
chemical release in your brain. You hold it in

02:43:35.453 --> 02:43:40.181
place, and you sit there a second and stare as it
slowly goes down your system. You feel the warm,

02:43:40.181 --> 02:43:49.626
curling burn from inside your belly that fine
alcohol gives you, that little shimmer of pins and

02:43:49.626 --> 02:43:53.731
needles down the back of your neck and your spine.
Your vision begins to blur a little bit. It takes

02:43:53.731 --> 02:43:56.916
you a lot of alcohol to get trashed, but you're a
little buzzed.

02:43:56.916 --> 02:44:05.156
TRAVIS: Sick. Awesome. Well played, sandkheg. I go
to sleep.

02:44:05.156 --> 02:44:10.405
MATT: With your nightcap, you are good to go.
Looking under the stars, you finish your

02:44:10.405 --> 02:44:16.359
meditation. Everyone else, you go to rest fine.
Throughout the evening you sleep. The last thing

02:44:16.359 --> 02:44:24.681
you see before you go to bed is the edge of the
mountain range, late into the night, and a small

02:44:24.681 --> 02:44:38.207
sparkle in a crescent shape. You ask one of the
hands to the side. He points over and says, "The

02:44:38.207 --> 02:44:45.013
"Bay of Gifts." This is the northern side where you
see Shamal, the port city. That's the last little

02:44:45.013 --> 02:44:50.456
bastion of civilization of Marquet as it begins to
approach from underneath as you all go to sleep.

02:44:50.456 --> 02:44:53.966
The continent is behind you.

02:44:53.966 --> 02:44:57.579
MARISHA: How many hours has it been?

02:44:57.579 --> 02:45:00.311
MATT: When you come to consciousness after the
evening's rest--

02:45:00.311 --> 02:45:08.236
LAURA: I want to hold Fenthras in my hand and keep
thinking about the things Saundor said.

02:45:08.236 --> 02:45:17.574
MATT: After a good eight hour rest for all of you
to recover yourselves, hit points, everything,

02:45:17.574 --> 02:45:34.368
spells, you come to. The warmth of the sun is what
kicks you into consciousness. It's been about 13

02:45:34.368 --> 02:45:42.983
hours since you guys left. Eight hours of rest.
You had five hours of travel northward until you

02:45:42.983 --> 02:45:46.593
began to reach the northern end of the continent
on this skyship.

02:45:46.593 --> 02:45:52.107
TALIESIN: This might be the best sleep that we've
gotten in months, at this point. Like babies.

02:45:52.107 --> 02:45:57.786
SAM: Is it morning time?

02:45:57.786 --> 02:45:58.979
MATT: Yeah.

02:45:58.979 --> 02:46:01.003
SAM: You want to do that morning scry?

02:46:01.003 --> 02:46:03.997
MARISHA: Yeah, morning scry.

02:46:03.997 --> 02:46:06.763
TALIESIN: I'm going to sit down with a pen and
paper, ready to write!

02:46:06.763 --> 02:46:17.109
MARISHA: Yeah, morning constitutional, here we
come. Bust out whatever magazines they have

02:46:17.109 --> 02:46:21.481
nearby. Cup of coffee, first.

02:46:21.481 --> 02:46:27.884
MATT: All right. Using the same journal?

02:46:27.884 --> 02:46:33.352
TALIESIN: Let's use the gun now. Let's go nuts.

02:46:33.352 --> 02:46:35.845
SAM: Now that it's been de-cursed, will that mess
up--

02:46:35.845 --> 02:46:38.763
TALIESIN: It's got a lot of her work in it.

02:46:38.763 --> 02:46:42.271
MATT: All right, are you using the crystal first?

02:46:42.271 --> 02:46:45.347
MARISHA: Yeah. Crystal first.

02:46:45.347 --> 02:46:50.416
MATT: What's the crystal DC? Because it's not your
actual spell, which I should have remembered last

02:46:50.416 --> 02:46:55.009
time. I mean, she rolled low enough last time that
it wasn't an issue.

02:46:55.009 --> 02:46:57.430
MARISHA: It doesn't say.

02:46:57.430 --> 02:47:08.013
MATT: Okay, then it should be 15. That's a natural
one. As you're concentrating on the scry spell,

02:47:08.013 --> 02:47:16.689
your vision once again is thrust through the
clouds, thrown down over the ocean. You see for a

02:47:16.689 --> 02:47:28.486
brief moment a cluster of dark land, roughly in
the shape of a bean or a cashew from this

02:47:28.486 --> 02:47:36.939
perspective, and then it flashes downward and you
can see a ship. A ship that is on the water. It is

02:47:36.939 --> 02:47:38.160
stationary.

02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.222
MARISHA: Docked, like anchors down?

02:47:40.222 --> 02:47:43.107
MATT: Seemingly. The sails aren't up.

02:47:43.107 --> 02:47:45.688
TRAVIS: It's not at land? It's in the water?

02:47:45.688 --> 02:47:54.313
MATT: Yeah. Your vision flashes again and you can
see the crew have all gathered on the deck, though

02:47:54.313 --> 02:48:06.295
details of their visage are obscured by the spell.
You see Ripley there with her cloak. She is

02:48:06.295 --> 02:48:15.206
talking to the rest of the crew and goes, "All
right, so. We've located it. We have eight hours.

02:48:15.206 --> 02:48:22.730
"Gather your things and drink well." They all pull
out these small vials, uncork, and drink down.

02:48:22.730 --> 02:48:39.140
They all nod. One by one, they start diving off
the ship and into the water. Five people, you're

02:48:39.140 --> 02:48:46.326
not sure of the sex, and Ripley, dive off the
side. You're following her as she goes underwater;

02:48:46.326 --> 02:48:51.221
you can see the bubbles go past. Then the bubbles
are no more and you watch as she is now breathing

02:48:51.221 --> 02:48:57.344
the water like it's air. Swimming downward. All of
them are carrying, you see on the side, these

02:48:57.344 --> 02:49:02.649
heavy rock weights that are letting them guide
down deeper into the water as it gets darker,

02:49:02.649 --> 02:49:11.074
until there's almost nothing to see. Then there's
a flicker of light and you see Ripley is now

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:17.112
holding her gun. There's a beam of light on the
end of it that's giving them torchlight as they go

02:49:17.112 --> 02:49:26.387
deeper in. Then the spell fades.

02:49:26.387 --> 02:49:30.372
MARISHA: She's found it. She's there.

02:49:30.372 --> 02:49:31.725
TRAVIS: She's got it?

02:49:31.725 --> 02:49:37.305
MARISHA: She doesn't have it, but she's found the
ship. She's right off the shore of the island.

02:49:37.305 --> 02:49:39.363
LAURA: Can you scry again immediately?

02:49:39.363 --> 02:49:43.114
MARISHA: She's under the water. I mean, I could.

02:49:43.114 --> 02:49:44.779
TRAVIS: How is she under the water?

02:49:44.779 --> 02:49:48.795
MARISHA: They all took water breathing potions.
Her plus five other people.

02:49:48.795 --> 02:49:55.827
TALIESIN: Was there anything around? Could you see
the island in sight?

02:49:55.827 --> 02:50:00.576
MARISHA: I saw the island. It was dark in
landscape.

02:50:00.576 --> 02:50:06.953
MATT: It was such a brief shot, because it wasn't
the focus of the scry spell. Even the fact that

02:50:06.953 --> 02:50:14.065
you caught a glimpse of it was a strange side
effect of the scry attempt.

02:50:14.065 --> 02:50:19.733
TALIESIN: Was the sun with the island, or was the
sun away from the island? Is there any way to even

02:50:19.733 --> 02:50:22.464
know that? Were they on the north side or the
south side?

02:50:22.464 --> 02:50:29.284
MATT: From what you can gather at this time, no.
That's part of the scry spell. You wouldn't be

02:50:29.284 --> 02:50:30.440
able to tell.

02:50:30.440 --> 02:50:35.213
LIAM: I'm heading over to find the captain and the
halfling to ask how far they estimate we are from

02:50:35.213 --> 02:50:36.571
the island.

02:50:36.571 --> 02:50:38.582
MARISHA: I heard Ripley say, "We have eight
hours."

02:50:38.582 --> 02:50:42.028
LAURA: That's how long the spell lasts.

02:50:42.028 --> 02:50:45.175
TRAVIS: I have two vials of underwater breathing.

02:50:45.175 --> 02:50:49.922
MARISHA: I'll take water breathing as a spell.

02:50:49.922 --> 02:50:52.265
LAURA: How many people can you cast it on?

02:50:52.265 --> 02:51:02.191
MATT: Water breathing as a spell actually lasts
for 24 hours. The potions only last for eight.

02:51:02.191 --> 02:51:04.330
MARISHA: Is it concentration?

02:51:04.330 --> 02:51:07.771
MATT: Nope. It grants up to ten willing creatures
you can see--

02:51:07.771 --> 02:51:09.566
MARISHA: What!? Ten willing?

02:51:09.566 --> 02:51:10.908
LAURA: That's sick.

02:51:10.908 --> 02:51:13.080
MARISHA: I got us on lock, you guys.

02:51:13.080 --> 02:51:16.629
TALIESIN: I had a plan. I'm putting it away.

02:51:16.629 --> 02:51:25.002
MATT: Yeah, so the potion enchantments are lesser
than the spell, but the actual druidic spell

02:51:25.002 --> 02:51:31.998
effect is much better. You see him looking off in
the distance as you're asking the question. He

02:51:31.998 --> 02:51:38.271
points and goes, "Well given &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; might slow us
down a bit--" You look ahead and you now see,

02:51:38.271 --> 02:51:40.582
immediately visible from this point--

02:51:40.582 --> 02:51:44.662
LAURA: Don't be a green dragon!

02:51:44.662 --> 02:52:00.389
MATT: What you are able to make out, because it's
a familiar sight to you, are very tall, dark,

02:52:00.389 --> 02:52:08.459
distant thunderheads. The storm that you saw in
your first vision, Keyleth, apparently is still

02:52:08.459 --> 02:52:13.906
swirling its way through the middle of the ocean.
It's violent, it's visceral, and you can see the

02:52:13.906 --> 02:52:19.528
weight of the water giving it this deep, dark,
gray color, and the rest of the ocean below is

02:52:19.528 --> 02:52:26.228
obscured with the blur of rainfall. He goes,
"Those are high clouds. I can't get above them.

02:52:26.228 --> 02:52:31.739
"The enchantment is only so strong to get us into
that thinner air. So I recommend everyone hold on."

02:52:31.739 --> 02:52:33.618
LIAM: Is there anything you can do about this?

02:52:33.618 --> 02:52:35.212
MARISHA: I can. Get us closer.

02:52:35.212 --> 02:52:36.578
MATT: "What?"

02:52:36.578 --> 02:52:39.067
TALIESIN: Trust her. She's crazy.

02:52:39.067 --> 02:52:44.032
MARISHA: Straight through, fastest route,
captain.

02:52:44.032 --> 02:52:49.089
MATT: "Okay, I trust you." He brings it around and
begins pulling forward. You can see this little

02:52:49.089 --> 02:52:53.759
metallic rod on the side and he pushes it forward
even further. The crystals flicker for a second

02:52:53.759 --> 02:53:07.877
and the whole ship leans in a forward direction.
It takes about an hour before the shade from the

02:53:07.877 --> 02:53:14.023
thunderheads, which, you can't even see where they
stop, they go up and up and up, begin to meet.

02:53:14.023 --> 02:53:17.163
You're starting to see flashes in the clouds of
lightning.

02:53:17.163 --> 02:53:30.619
MARISHA: I go ahead and I start casting my first
8th-level spell, which is Control Weather. It's

02:53:30.619 --> 02:53:37.316
everything I've ever wanted, you guys!

02:53:37.316 --> 02:53:46.425
MATT: Yeah, concentration for up to eight hours.
So you guys watch as Keyleth stands at the bow of

02:53:46.425 --> 02:53:53.136
the ship, puts her arms out, and you see the
flashes of lightning in the cloud. A bolt strikes

02:53:53.136 --> 02:54:00.202
her in one arm. She holds it in place. The bolt
uses her as a conduit and then vanishes into her

02:54:00.202 --> 02:54:05.899
arm. Her other arm pulls another bolt to it, and
it vanishes into her arm. You can see the energy's

02:54:05.899 --> 02:54:11.047
now circling around. She brings her arms out and
thrusts them into the storm. The lightning

02:54:11.047 --> 02:54:17.364
protrudes out of each arm. As it hits the clouds,
the clouds seem to almost melt away and carve this

02:54:17.364 --> 02:54:24.478
central path. The clouds are being pushed back, at
gale force. These winds are separating them. You

02:54:24.478 --> 02:54:30.520
watch. For five miles around you, the storm
basically parts to nearly nothing except for the

02:54:30.520 --> 02:54:38.159
very peripheral to the right and left side. You
hear Captain Damon go, "Okay! I see your point."

02:54:38.159 --> 02:54:42.809
LIAM: Hot fucking damn, Keyleth!

02:54:42.809 --> 02:54:48.677
LAURA: You know, I thought it was a possibility,
but this is the first time I'm sure your

02:54:48.677 --> 02:54:50.841
girlfriend is way cooler than you.

02:54:50.841 --> 02:54:52.747
LIAM: Everyone knew that.

02:54:52.747 --> 02:55:02.748
MATT: So pushing forward, Keyleth is concentrating
at the edge of the ship. Her eyes spark with

02:55:02.748 --> 02:55:06.499
energy. You're almost like the mermaid at the
front of the ship at this point. You're right at

02:55:06.499 --> 02:55:07.596
the front, arms out.

02:55:07.596 --> 02:55:10.816
LIAM: You're like a reverse Pyro. You're undoing
all the violence.

02:55:10.816 --> 02:55:17.972
MATT: The shade fades away. The clear blue sky
above then invites these warm sun beams down upon

02:55:17.972 --> 02:55:19.446
the top of the ship.

02:55:19.446 --> 02:55:21.034
LAURA: I do some sunbathing.

02:55:21.034 --> 02:55:26.284
MARISHA: I make it temperate with a nice warm
breeze.

02:55:26.284 --> 02:55:30.666
SAM: Keyleth, can you make the breeze behind us,
and can you make it rather strong?

02:55:30.666 --> 02:55:33.752
MARISHA: Can I do that?

02:55:33.752 --> 02:55:38.746
TALIESIN: He's reading! He doesn't know.

02:55:38.746 --> 02:55:43.035
SAM: Well, you said it lasts eight hours.

02:55:43.035 --> 02:55:47.592
TALIESIN: He's checking to see if it's a thing you
can actually do.

02:55:47.592 --> 02:55:49.573
LIAM: Checking his stocks. Message from mom.

02:55:49.573 --> 02:56:00.477
MATT: What you can do is you can clear the storm
for five miles, and then subtly change to a wind

02:56:00.477 --> 02:56:03.979
stage behind you, yes. I'll let you do that,
sure.

02:56:03.979 --> 02:56:09.077
MARISHA: Make the winds in our favor! I'm drunk on
power!

02:56:09.077 --> 02:56:13.949
MATT: The wind begins to build from behind. Some
of you have to duck down now because it's starting

02:56:13.949 --> 02:56:21.154
to take. It almost takes your hat off, Scanlan.
You catch it. But it is picking up speed and you

02:56:21.154 --> 02:56:26.701
guys are beginning to coast forward. Occasionally
the winds die down as you have to clear more of

02:56:26.701 --> 02:56:33.016
the storm. Over the next six or so hours, you come
out the other side of the storm.

02:56:33.016 --> 02:56:39.574
MARISHA: I go into a deep meditation. This is some
Buddhist shit going on for me right now.

02:56:39.574 --> 02:56:53.064
MATT: Perfect. As the storm subsides, your ship
has a clear view of distant breaks in the patterns

02:56:53.064 --> 02:57:01.129
of waves on the horizon. Multiple chained islands,
many miles apart from each other, emerge. This,

02:57:01.129 --> 02:57:06.219
you've now begun to reach, is the Hespet
Archipelago. Each of the twelve islands vary in

02:57:06.219 --> 02:57:15.609
size from massive rock to pebble-like protrusions.
They span and are scattered, and the ship begins

02:57:15.609 --> 02:57:24.195
to veer to the left as the captain begins to zero
in on your destination. He yells out, "We're going

02:57:24.195 --> 02:57:33.407
"low! They have visibility!" The ship begins to go
into a relatively steep decline. You hear the wood

02:57:33.407 --> 02:57:42.014
creaking with the sudden shift in direction and
weight. The gem on the right side begins to

02:57:42.014 --> 02:57:47.979
brighten while the one on the left begins to
darken slightly, exemplifying the shift in energy

02:57:47.979 --> 02:57:52.782
and power. Eventually you're brought down, nearly
coasting on the surface of the ocean, and as you

02:57:52.782 --> 02:57:58.278
get to about 40, 50 feet above you see the waves
begin to part beneath it as whatever force is

02:57:58.278 --> 02:58:03.040
holding it there is now pushing the water down. He
brings it up a little so it's not breaking the

02:58:03.040 --> 02:58:12.543
surface and coasts at an even 60 feet above.
Pushing forward, you already begin to see what you

02:58:12.543 --> 02:58:22.542
assume is the Isle of Glintshore. In this clear,
sunlit moment, you also see, throughout the ocean,

02:58:22.542 --> 02:58:32.999
clusters of dangerous, jagged-looking reef, some
ten, 15 below the surface, some actually breaching

02:58:32.999 --> 02:58:39.725
the surface of the ocean, some even deeper. This
portion of the ocean is like a maze network of

02:58:39.725 --> 02:58:48.725
every ship captain's nightmare. You get the
feeling why this has become a favored place of

02:58:48.725 --> 02:58:58.196
criminals to avoid pursuers and also why people
who trade avoid it for many reasons, not just

02:58:58.196 --> 02:59:06.189
those who stay here. And also why the shipwreck
probably found its way here. As you begin to grow

02:59:06.189 --> 02:59:12.610
closer to the island, you see, as it begins to
come more into form, there is a singular mountain

02:59:12.610 --> 02:59:20.781
peak that's shifted mostly to the western side.
It's not a super peak. It's a gradual point. You

02:59:20.781 --> 02:59:28.773
can see a little bit of a brush-like detail of the
jungle that you had heard mentioned before. He

02:59:28.773 --> 02:59:36.161
begins to bring you up towards the southern shore
of the island. At this point of perspective, the

02:59:36.161 --> 02:59:42.694
sunlight that's hitting the island is causing a
glittery shift of thousands of points of light

02:59:42.694 --> 02:59:51.557
across the beach shoreline, deep into where the
blackened jungle tree line is. It's beautiful.

02:59:51.557 --> 02:59:59.735
It's a very strange and awe-inspiring sight, to be
such a small little forgotten part of the land and

02:59:59.735 --> 03:00:01.687
to look so pretty from this distance.

03:00:01.687 --> 03:00:08.525
The closer you get, the beauty begins to
fade as you see the black beaches. You can see the

03:00:08.525 --> 03:00:19.076
landscape is barren and broken, aside from the
ashen gray and black jungle plants and trees that

03:00:19.174 --> 03:00:24.236
have been left there, dead, for an extended period
of time. The mountain itself, the rock itself

03:00:24.236 --> 03:00:30.861
going from black to a ruddy red and brown color.
The sands themselves and the glass surface across

03:00:30.861 --> 03:00:38.599
the eastern shore that tends to reach out, almost
like a mouth of a creature, is rough and varied in

03:00:38.599 --> 03:00:47.705
topography. You also see, within that bay, a tiny
little thing that looks like a ship.

03:00:47.705 --> 03:00:51.596
LIAM: Are we close enough to see if there's people
on the deck?

03:00:51.596 --> 03:00:54.702
MATT: You're not close enough. You're barely now
seeing that there's a ship.

03:00:54.702 --> 03:00:58.361
MARISHA: It's been six hours, you said, since I
did my scry.

03:00:58.361 --> 03:01:00.774
MATT: Probably about seven hours now, since you
did the spell.

03:01:00.774 --> 03:01:02.509
LAURA: They're going to be coming out any minute.

03:01:02.509 --> 03:01:04.335
MARISHA: They have one hour left.

03:01:04.335 --> 03:01:05.639
LAURA: Unless they're already out.

03:01:05.639 --> 03:01:09.373
LIAM: Yeah, that's the duration of the spell, the
eight hours. They could be back already.

03:01:09.373 --> 03:01:12.507
MARISHA: If we have one hour left, they could
fail. They could not find it at all.

03:01:12.507 --> 03:01:16.444
LAURA: Could we shoot the boat from above and
destroy their escape?

03:01:16.444 --> 03:01:23.477
TRAVIS: Could I make a song request? Could we drop
your big rocky ass from 300 feet up right through

03:01:23.477 --> 03:01:25.181
the bottom of their ship and sink that bitch?

03:01:25.181 --> 03:01:27.511
TALIESIN: I'll also say, there's nothing a ship
doesn't like more than fire.

03:01:27.511 --> 03:01:29.053
LAURA: Yes.

03:01:29.053 --> 03:01:33.711
MARISHA: I mean, all of these things are very
appealing to me right now. I'm just trying to

03:01:33.711 --> 03:01:37.453
understand why.

03:01:37.453 --> 03:01:38.710
SAM: Well, we can't let them escape.

03:01:38.710 --> 03:01:42.862
LIAM: It's better that they're floating on the
water than standing on the ship.

03:01:42.862 --> 03:01:45.059
TRAVIS: And if they have a teleportation circle on
the boat, we want to destroy it.

03:01:45.059 --> 03:01:47.752
MARISHA: She also has the cloak we want.

03:01:47.752 --> 03:01:51.704
LAURA: Right. So we wait until she drowns, and
then we take it from her.

03:01:51.704 --> 03:01:54.203
TALIESIN: We can retrieve it from the bottom of
the sea, if we have to.

03:01:54.203 --> 03:01:59.831
MARISHA: What do we know about magical items? Do
they get destroyed by things like fire or me being

03:01:59.831 --> 03:02:00.707
a meteor?

03:02:00.707 --> 03:02:04.667
MATT: Generally, no. Magical items, a part of the
enchantment is to make them resistant to the

03:02:04.667 --> 03:02:12.173
general elements. They endure, and the reason that
you find mostly just the enchanted objects in

03:02:12.173 --> 03:02:18.111
ancient ruins is because everything that would be
destroyed by the weathering of time, these items

03:02:18.111 --> 03:02:19.679
stay relatively pristine.

03:02:19.679 --> 03:02:21.615
MARISHA: Then yes, I'm down to fuck this shit up.

03:02:21.615 --> 03:02:30.295
LAURA: I wonder if she hired the boat, or if it's
hers. I would hate to kill innocent crew members.

03:02:30.295 --> 03:02:33.796
TALIESIN: I don't think they're innocent crew
members. I think she had help.

03:02:33.796 --> 03:02:36.268
SAM: She had five killers with her when she killed
those--

03:02:36.268 --> 03:02:44.374
MATT: You did see, for the record, in your
scrying, while there were five that leapt down

03:02:44.374 --> 03:02:45.965
with her, there were more on the ship.

03:02:45.965 --> 03:02:48.962
SAM: It's fine, we'll throw them a life raft or
something.

03:02:48.962 --> 03:02:53.840
LIAM: Then I'd like to put my vote in for the
meteor.

03:02:53.840 --> 03:02:57.355
TRAVIS: They're also in the bay, so they can swim
to shore.

03:02:57.355 --> 03:03:05.759
LIAM: Well, we can stop their retreat. They're
going to be in worse shape without that boat.

03:03:05.759 --> 03:03:08.387
TRAVIS: I want to send a message to the ship, is
all.

03:03:08.387 --> 03:03:15.611
MATT: The captain's like, "What do you want me to
do? Do you want me to head for the ship?"

03:03:15.611 --> 03:03:17.150
SAM: Up above the ship.

03:03:17.150 --> 03:03:22.921
TRAVIS: And Vax rides Keyleth down, like Dr.
Strangelove, the whole way.

03:03:22.921 --> 03:03:30.556
SAM: You're going to take a lot of damage?

03:03:30.556 --> 03:03:33.832
MARISHA: He can fly.

03:03:33.832 --> 03:03:40.515
LAURA: Can you cast Water Breathing on us before
you fly down, and that way-- or is that going to

03:03:40.515 --> 03:03:42.185
fuck up your spells?

03:03:42.185 --> 03:03:45.949
MARISHA: It's not a concentration spell, right?
Water breathing?

03:03:45.949 --> 03:03:47.599
MATT: No, it's not concentration.

03:03:47.599 --> 03:03:49.146
LIAM: And it lasts a long time.

03:03:49.146 --> 03:03:53.000
LAURA: 24 hours. So just in case we end up in the
water, we're not fucked.

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.231
TALIESIN: We have ten people, 12 people?

03:03:55.231 --> 03:04:02.752
TRAVIS: Last song request. We destroy the ship,
right? It (burbling) and they all (burbling) come

03:04:02.752 --> 03:04:08.430
up to the top, they got to go one place, which is
where? The shore. So why don't we wait on the shore?

03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:11.109
MARISHA: Well do we want to drop your ass off on
the shore?

03:04:11.109 --> 03:04:14.927
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, I mean, I'd love to be a
welcoming party. I'm just saying, if anyone else

03:04:14.927 --> 03:04:17.902
wants to come with, that's where I know they'll be
going.

03:04:17.902 --> 03:04:20.412
TALIESIN: I'm hoping to take care of this before
the ship even sinks.

03:04:20.412 --> 03:04:22.125
LAURA: I can be death from above on the broom.

03:04:22.125 --> 03:04:27.983
MARISHA: This is my favorite plan we've come up
with in a long time.

03:04:27.983 --> 03:04:30.664
SAM: We should probably make sure that this is the
right boat.

03:04:30.664 --> 03:04:34.261
LAURA: Yes, yes, we need to double check that this
is actually the boat.

03:04:34.261 --> 03:04:36.971
MARISHA: Does this look like the right boat?

03:04:36.971 --> 03:04:38.935
MATT: You're a little ways from it. Are you going
to wait until you get closer?

03:04:38.935 --> 03:04:42.267
TRAVIS: Is there a telescope on this ship?

03:04:42.267 --> 03:04:44.676
MATT: There is one that you've been using.

03:04:44.676 --> 03:04:48.001
LAURA: Can you cast a spell, just in case shit
happens, as soon as we get close enough to the ship?

03:04:48.001 --> 03:04:49.312
MARISHA: Dispel?

03:04:49.312 --> 03:04:51.380
LAURA: No, the spell, the breathing spell.

03:04:51.380 --> 03:04:55.549
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. What's our ETA, captain?

03:04:55.549 --> 03:05:01.340
MATT: "At this speed, I'd say 20 minutes."

03:05:01.340 --> 03:05:10.258
MARISHA: I'll wait ten minutes, because I like to
milk my time.

03:05:10.258 --> 03:05:17.370
MATT: All right, ten minutes go by. Who is keeping
watch through the telescope?

03:05:17.370 --> 03:05:18.514
LAURA: Me.

03:05:18.514 --> 03:05:20.852
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

03:05:20.852 --> 03:05:22.834
SAM: Wait, but Keyleth knows what the boat looks
like.

03:05:22.834 --> 03:05:24.440
LAURA: She told me all about it.

03:05:24.440 --> 03:05:25.602
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:05:25.602 --> 03:05:31.603
LAURA: 25.

03:05:31.603 --> 03:05:36.664
MATT: 25, all right. You're scanning across.
Looking at the ship: the sails are up, it is

03:05:36.664 --> 03:05:44.503
anchored, and there are maybe four individuals who
are currently playing cards on the upper deck.

03:05:44.503 --> 03:05:46.794
LAURA: It looks like the boat's been docked there
for a while.

03:05:46.794 --> 03:05:53.464
MATT: You also notice, scanning the area, it
catches your eye, there's a very lazy, very faint

03:05:53.464 --> 03:06:00.391
trail that looks like smoke on the shore of the
C-shaped bay on the eastern side of the island.

03:06:00.391 --> 03:06:10.194
LAURA: A camp on the shoreline?

03:06:10.194 --> 03:06:12.877
MATT: That might be a source for the smoke.

03:06:12.877 --> 03:06:14.544
LAURA: Is it close by the boat?

03:06:14.544 --> 03:06:21.240
MATT: If you're looking from your perspective,
this is the eastern side and it has this C-shaped

03:06:21.240 --> 03:06:27.928
bay right here, where this is the shoreline. The
ship is docked right about here in the water. It's

03:06:27.928 --> 03:06:32.137
surrounded by a reef. It's barely made its way in
there and it can't go any further without hitting

03:06:32.137 --> 03:06:36.817
reef. The smoke is right there. It's right on the
beach side.

03:06:36.817 --> 03:06:40.488
TRAVIS: Can we see the other side of the island,
or the water on the other side, from this vantage point?

03:06:40.488 --> 03:06:42.434
MATT: No, not from this vantage point.

03:06:42.434 --> 03:06:50.546
LAURA: Can you scry and see if she's still
underwater, or if she's camping? Because I see smoke.

03:06:50.546 --> 03:06:55.405
SAM: Can Keyleth look through the-- we have a
telescope of some sort?

03:06:55.405 --> 03:06:57.182
MATT: There is a telescope, yeah.

03:06:57.182 --> 03:07:01.456
SAM: Can she look and see if the boat looks right?
Did you see any identifying marks on the boat?

03:07:01.456 --> 03:07:04.167
TALIESIN: It's not like there's going to be a
dozen of them out here.

03:07:04.167 --> 03:07:05.830
LIAM: It would be a very big coincidence.

03:07:05.830 --> 03:07:09.780
MARISHA: I look through the telescope. Does it
look like the same boat?

03:07:09.780 --> 03:07:11.452
MATT: Perception check.

03:07:11.452 --> 03:07:16.742
MARISHA: I rolled an 18, so 29.

03:07:16.742 --> 03:07:22.916
MATT: Yes, this is very much the boat. Size,
color, shape, placement, this is the same ship.

03:07:22.916 --> 03:07:24.872
TRAVIS: Thought we were getting ready to kill a
cruise ship.

03:07:24.872 --> 03:07:26.355
MARISHA: Okay, so am I scrying?

03:07:26.355 --> 03:07:28.508
LAURA: Well I guess you don't need to now.

03:07:28.508 --> 03:07:32.627
SAM: We'd know if she's still underwater or if
she's on land.

03:07:32.627 --> 03:07:35.151
LAURA: There's people on the boat waiting still.

03:07:35.151 --> 03:07:40.681
MATT: You are ten minutes from getting there. It
takes ten minutes to cast scrying.

03:07:40.681 --> 03:07:42.839
TRAVIS: No, we don't need it.

03:07:42.839 --> 03:07:44.838
LAURA: But you should probably cast breathing.

03:07:44.838 --> 03:07:47.213
MARISHA: It takes me 30 seconds to scry once I get
there.

03:07:47.213 --> 03:07:48.671
SAM: Let's scry.

03:07:48.671 --> 03:07:50.344
MARISHA: I'm going to scry.

03:07:50.344 --> 03:07:52.207
LAURA: But cast breathing on us first.

03:07:52.207 --> 03:07:54.550
MARISHA: I'm going to cast Water Breathing, and
then I'm going to scry.

03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:55.995
TALIESIn: Wait, can you do me a favor?

03:07:55.995 --> 03:08:00.757
MARISHA: I'm dishing them out. I'm the magic ATM
right now. What do you want?

03:08:00.757 --> 03:08:07.052
TALIESIN: Once we're somewhat in the distance,
fire an eyeball and get a good look at that ship.

03:08:07.052 --> 03:08:13.192
I want to see if it's a trap. You have an arrow.

03:08:13.192 --> 03:08:15.945
LAURA: Yes, I do. Once we get close enough.

03:08:15.945 --> 03:08:22.558
MARISHA: Okay, so I go to everybody and I say, you
have Water Breathing, you have Water Breathing.

03:08:22.558 --> 03:08:34.744
And everyone has Water Breathing. Then I go,
everyone leave me alone for ten minutes. I drop

03:08:34.744 --> 03:08:36.105
down and I Scry.

03:08:36.105 --> 03:08:42.667
MATT: Okay. So you begin concentrating as you guys
get closer and closer to the ship. You can now see

03:08:42.667 --> 03:08:44.251
it getting closer and closer.

03:08:44.251 --> 03:08:46.961
TRAVIS: Do we want to raise our elevation as we're
getting closer?

03:08:46.961 --> 03:08:49.809
SAM: Yeah, we told him to go up above it.

03:08:49.809 --> 03:08:53.189
MATT: You guys begin to notice, you, Vex, as
you're looking through, the people who were

03:08:53.189 --> 03:08:56.629
playing cards start moving on the deck of the
ship. They start scattering.

03:08:56.629 --> 03:08:57.792
LAURA: Are they seeing us?

03:08:57.792 --> 03:09:01.833
MATT: They have seen you. You're not a hard vision
to see once they pay attention.

03:09:01.833 --> 03:09:06.902
LAURA: Do they look like they're looking over the
sides of the boat?

03:09:06.902 --> 03:09:10.355
MATT: Roll a perception check.

03:09:10.355 --> 03:09:17.311
SAM: This is like the Hindenburg flying up to a
rowboat.

03:09:17.311 --> 03:09:18.662
LAURA: 20.

03:09:18.662 --> 03:09:19.639
MATT: No.

03:09:19.639 --> 03:09:21.349
LAURA: No, they don't look like they're looking
over the side of the boat?

03:09:21.349 --> 03:09:27.597
MATT: No. Okay, you're starting to get closer and
closer. You watch as they all scatter into the

03:09:27.597 --> 03:09:33.868
bottom of the boat, except for one who stands on
the deck. You watch, (launching sound) this one

03:09:33.868 --> 03:09:39.420
sparkle of bright red arcane energy (fizzing) up
into the sky, (explosion)--

03:09:39.420 --> 03:09:41.017
SAM: A flare.

03:09:41.017 --> 03:09:48.432
MATT: --with a dull burst exploding sound, and
then vanishes. The explosion dissipates.

03:09:48.432 --> 03:09:50.199
LAURA: Yeah, it's a flare.

03:09:50.199 --> 03:09:52.815
SAM: To warn the people on land.

03:09:52.815 --> 03:09:55.001
MATT: Another one (fizzing).

03:09:55.001 --> 03:09:57.034
LAURA: Okay, okay. Shit.

03:09:57.034 --> 03:09:58.743
SAM: How do we get to land quickly?

03:09:58.743 --> 03:10:02.303
LAURA: I can fly there on my broom, but I don't
fly very quickly.

03:10:02.303 --> 03:10:04.788
TALIESIN: Are we close enough that one of her
arrows can make it?

03:10:04.788 --> 03:10:08.979
MATT: No, you're about three minutes out now from
approaching it.

03:10:08.979 --> 03:10:10.810
TRAVIS: The ship or the shore?

03:10:10.810 --> 03:10:12.047
MATT: The ship.

03:10:12.047 --> 03:10:18.859
SAM: We should split. Some should go to the beach,
some should continue with plan Drop Keyleth--

03:10:18.859 --> 03:10:20.753
TRAVIS: I'm going to the beach. I can't, yeah.

03:10:20.753 --> 03:10:22.432
SAM: How are you getting to the beach? You can't
fly.

03:10:22.432 --> 03:10:24.107
TRAVIS: Oh.

03:10:24.107 --> 03:10:27.048
TALIESIN: Once we're close enough, you can port
them down.

03:10:27.048 --> 03:10:30.266
SAM: I can make you a thing that flies, to get you
there.

03:10:30.266 --> 03:10:31.651
TRAVIS: What kind of thing?

03:10:31.651 --> 03:10:32.964
SAM: I don't know. Giant eagle?

03:10:32.964 --> 03:10:36.105
TRAVIS: You worry about other stuff.

03:10:36.105 --> 03:10:37.390
LAURA: A pterodactyl.

03:10:37.390 --> 03:10:42.263
TRAVIS: That sounds like our only option, yeah.

03:10:42.263 --> 03:10:46.196
LAURA: Three more minutes of scrying, still? Maybe
the scrying was ill-timed.

03:10:46.196 --> 03:10:47.466
MATT: Two minutes.

03:10:47.466 --> 03:10:50.177
SAM: All right, Grog. You and me. Come on, let's
go.

03:10:50.177 --> 03:10:53.931
LAURA: Oh jeez. I ready the broom. I get on the
broom and wait.

03:10:53.931 --> 03:10:57.670
TALIESIN: Prepare, I'm telling the men, prepare
the harpoons. It may be a trap.

03:10:57.670 --> 03:11:03.623
MATT: "Understood. Man the harpoons!" You see they
all run off to the various, the three different

03:11:03.623 --> 03:11:06.788
dragon arbalist stations.

03:11:06.788 --> 03:11:12.330
TALIESIN: Prepare for a hard turn to shore if they
begin to show any signs of magical attack.

03:11:12.330 --> 03:11:18.288
MATT: "Understood." You can now see the captain's
gone into war mode now. He's keeping focus forward

03:11:18.288 --> 03:11:20.012
as he's pushing the ship.

03:11:20.012 --> 03:11:23.348
TRAVIS: How do we communicate with the captain
once we're off the ship? Should we give him an

03:11:23.348 --> 03:11:24.419
earring?

03:11:24.419 --> 03:11:31.939
SAM: It won't reach, it's too far. Grog, I can
make you a thing that flies. Should I? All right,

03:11:31.939 --> 03:11:38.653
I make him a giant eagle using Polymorph. I can't
do it to me, though, so you're on your own.

03:11:38.653 --> 03:11:39.866
LAURA: Well you can hop on his back.

03:11:39.866 --> 03:11:41.294
SAM: Oh yeah, good call!

03:11:41.294 --> 03:11:43.026
TRAVIS: I'm a big-ass eagle.

03:11:43.026 --> 03:11:50.228
MATT: Second time. Now the wings flare out, and
you remember, oh, flying! I'm smarter! Your

03:11:50.228 --> 03:11:55.876
Flowers for Algernon moment comes in the form of a
feathered bird.

03:11:55.876 --> 03:11:58.164
LIAM: a^2 + b^2 = c^2.

03:11:58.164 --> 03:11:59.948
TRAVIS: No it doesn't.

03:11:59.948 --> 03:12:04.818
MATT: Scanlan, you have to rush to get there
because he's almost completely taken aback by the

03:12:04.818 --> 03:12:11.839
moment and goes to fly. You catch him, barely, as
he leaps off the side of the ship. You guys head

03:12:11.839 --> 03:12:12.996
off toward the--

03:12:12.996 --> 03:12:14.223
TRAVIS: In a wide arc.

03:12:14.223 --> 03:12:19.457
TALIESIN: I tell the captain, no matter what
happens, use your judgment with any man or sailor

03:12:19.457 --> 03:12:24.074
who wishes to parlay and come aboard, but if any
woman attempts to come on board you do not

03:12:24.074 --> 03:12:26.669
recognize as one of us, kill her. Kill her
immediately.

03:12:26.669 --> 03:12:29.650
TRAVIS: What if she's looking like nothing but
a--

03:12:29.650 --> 03:12:32.665
LAURA: Anybody that comes on board, lock them up.
Immediately.

03:12:32.665 --> 03:12:34.042
TALIESIN: At the very least.

03:12:34.042 --> 03:12:35.791
SAM: And kill them.

03:12:35.791 --> 03:12:37.521
TALIESIN: Check for a fake arm, and remove it.

03:12:37.521 --> 03:12:38.816
MATT: "Loud and clear."

03:12:38.816 --> 03:12:43.416
LAURA: I tell Trinket to hop in the necklace
because we're going to be traveling very quickly, dear.

03:12:43.416 --> 03:12:45.199
MATT: Into the necklace.

03:12:45.199 --> 03:12:52.151
TALIESIN: I'm trying to use the scope on my big,
on Bad News to see if anything interesting is

03:12:52.151 --> 03:12:55.658
happening on the deck. Can I see the person who
was firing the flares?

03:12:55.658 --> 03:12:59.718
MATT: The person that's now fired three flares is
now running below the deck.

03:12:59.718 --> 03:13:03.696
TALIESIN: All right. They're all below the deck?

03:13:03.696 --> 03:13:06.689
MATT: Seemingly everybody is below the deck right
now, yes.

03:13:06.689 --> 03:13:10.089
TALIESIN: It's a trap. Let's move away from the
ship. Move toward the beach.

03:13:10.089 --> 03:13:12.697
SAM: But we've got to sink the ship.

03:13:12.697 --> 03:13:14.765
TALIESIN: We're going to sink this ship from a
distance.

03:13:14.765 --> 03:13:17.074
LAURA: She's still scrying. We can, they might be
by the ship.

03:13:17.074 --> 03:13:18.571
TALIESIN: I tell them to turn. Turn now!

03:13:18.571 --> 03:13:20.522
MATT: "Aye, aye!"

03:13:20.522 --> 03:13:23.699
LAURA: I shoot the arrow and try to get to the
boat. The oracle arrow.

03:13:23.699 --> 03:13:29.051
MATT: The ship suddenly begins to list very
heavily to the left side. All the hands grab hold

03:13:29.051 --> 03:13:34.094
who are currently stationed at the various
elements. You can see things on the deck, ropes

03:13:34.094 --> 03:13:38.905
and various odds and ends, pieces of metal, coins,
all begin drifting to one side, some tumbling over

03:13:38.905 --> 03:13:45.699
into the ocean below. You all hold on tight as you
pull around the side. Keyleth, I need you to make

03:13:45.699 --> 03:13:46.921
a concentration check.

03:13:46.921 --> 03:13:49.137
LAURA: Oh, come on!

03:13:49.137 --> 03:13:57.847
MATT: I'm giving you advantage because it isn't a
huge issue. Constitution saving throw.

03:13:57.847 --> 03:14:02.390
SAM: What are they going to do? They don't have
anything that can fight us. They're deck hands.

03:14:02.390 --> 03:14:08.561
TALIESIN: Why are they down below? There's no
hiding in the middle of the ocean. That's a death

03:14:08.561 --> 03:14:09.561
sentence.

03:14:09.561 --> 03:14:10.671
MARISHA: Okay, 13.

03:14:10.671 --> 03:14:15.453
MATT: You're fine. As it's turning, all of a
sudden your eyes flare open with vision. So this

03:14:15.453 --> 03:14:18.183
is not with the journal, correct?

03:14:18.183 --> 03:14:21.259
TALIESIN: She's still got my gun.

03:14:21.259 --> 03:14:33.908
MATT: So what's your spell DC? 19 plus, okay. As
the ship lists, your vision flashes and, for a

03:14:33.908 --> 03:14:40.990
second, your vision focuses on Ripley's face. You
see a spark of blue energy, similar to the inside

03:14:40.990 --> 03:14:45.653
of the cloak that you saw the first time with your
vision. The spell kicks out.

03:14:45.653 --> 03:14:47.661
MARISHA: Son of a bitch!

03:14:47.661 --> 03:14:51.864
LAURA: Was it underwater? Can you at least tell
that much?

03:14:51.864 --> 03:14:53.064
MATT: No.

03:14:53.064 --> 03:14:56.118
LAURA: Fuck. Good times.

03:14:56.118 --> 03:14:57.828
MATT: You find yourself sliding.

03:14:57.828 --> 03:15:00.583
LIAM: Are we above the ship at the moment?

03:15:00.583 --> 03:15:02.610
MARISHA: I grab Vax for safety.

03:15:02.610 --> 03:15:10.059
MATT: All right, you guys hold on. The ship turns,
a very quick turn, heading toward the shore.

03:15:10.059 --> 03:15:17.670
TALIESIN: We are, we've got two fliers. I'm going
to, I think it's time, we're going to attack them

03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:20.195
if we can with the bolts. If that's possible.

03:15:20.195 --> 03:15:21.968
MATT: If you give them the order, they will.

03:15:21.968 --> 03:15:24.128
MARISHA: Percy, I can destroy that ship if we get
over it.

03:15:24.128 --> 03:15:26.117
LIAM: I think we should still go.

03:15:26.117 --> 03:15:28.148
MATT: "Are we firing? What do you need?''

03:15:28.148 --> 03:15:29.516
LIAM: Keyleth, you ready? Let's go.

03:15:29.516 --> 03:15:30.595
TALIESIN: Let's fire.

03:15:30.595 --> 03:15:32.615
MARISHA: I go with Vax.

03:15:32.615 --> 03:15:36.030
TALIESIN: They're going to go. I'm going to fire
on the ship. Fire on the ship!

03:15:36.030 --> 03:15:40.462
MATT: "Fire!" He yells out. You watch as the
arbalists all pull back, (arrows releasing). As

03:15:40.462 --> 03:15:47.418
they release it, they have these giant, hard, dark
iron bolts that are loaded into these. As they

03:15:47.418 --> 03:15:52.140
release them, they go traveling through the
dragon's mouth. The dragon's mouth bursts into

03:15:52.140 --> 03:16:00.091
flame and lights the bolts into arcane fire. All
launch off and arc downward. One of them misses,

03:16:00.091 --> 03:16:05.148
(splashing) into the water, but two go slamming
into the side of the ship. You see wood

03:16:05.148 --> 03:16:10.313
splintering. You see flames begin to crawl along
the side while both of you, what are you doing?

03:16:10.313 --> 03:16:13.054
MARISHA: I'm holding on to him, piggyback ride
style.

03:16:13.054 --> 03:16:17.363
LIAM: I'm on your back, or piggyback? Aren't you
going earth elemental?

03:16:17.363 --> 03:16:20.559
MARISHA: I got to get over the ship. I can't fly
as an earth elemental!

03:16:20.559 --> 03:16:21.960
LIAM: Here we go!

03:16:21.960 --> 03:16:27.017
MATT: All right, as she's saying this, you leap
off, wings go out, coasting down over the ship. You

03:16:27.017 --> 03:16:31.185
begin to glide under as you can see the
explosions. They begin loading up the second round

03:16:31.185 --> 03:16:36.352
of assault on the ship. You arc around, keeping
her on your back. You guys are coming down toward

03:16:36.352 --> 03:16:41.537
the ship. You now watch as another volley, two
miss but a third one hits. Another splinter of

03:16:41.537 --> 03:16:44.160
various pieces of the ship bow torn asunder.

03:16:44.160 --> 03:16:46.954
MARISHA: I wait until he gets me over top of the
boat. As soon as he gets me over top.

03:16:46.954 --> 03:16:51.866
MATT: You coast up on the side. You watch as one
of the three large masts begins to slowly fall

03:16:51.866 --> 03:16:58.616
over from the impact of the various assaults from
the ship. You are now up over the ship itself.

03:16:58.616 --> 03:16:59.837
LIAM: You ready to do this?

03:16:59.837 --> 03:17:00.987
MARISHA: Nice and high, nice and high!

03:17:00.987 --> 03:17:02.602
LIAM: All right, we're going to twist in the air!
Here we go!

03:17:02.602 --> 03:17:07.176
MATT: As this is happening, you see one of them
has come over from inside of the ship and is

03:17:07.176 --> 03:17:12.379
watching this attack happen. You can barely see,
he looks harried but he looks up and releases.

03:17:12.379 --> 03:17:16.115
MARISHA: I let go. We're over the boat?

03:17:16.115 --> 03:17:18.035
MATT: You guys are over the boat now, yes.

03:17:18.035 --> 03:17:20.521
TALIESIN: Is there any way I could have gotten any
of this in my scope?

03:17:20.521 --> 03:17:24.359
MATT: You know what, yes. Well make a perception
check first, actually, to see if you've seen this.

03:17:24.359 --> 03:17:28.969
LIAM: As we're twisting in the air, I cast Bless
on Keyleth and myself.

03:17:28.969 --> 03:17:38.153
MATT: Make a concentration check because you are
flying. A constitution saving throw.

03:17:38.153 --> 03:17:45.565
LIAM: 18. That means that you and I, whenever we
make an attack roll or a saving throw for the next

03:17:45.565 --> 03:17:47.205
minute, add a d4.

03:17:47.205 --> 03:17:49.811
TALIESIN: 14.

03:17:49.811 --> 03:17:56.176
MATT: 14? You can make the attack. It'll be at
disadvantage because of the distance. This is with

03:17:56.176 --> 03:17:57.250
Bad News, I assume?

03:17:57.250 --> 03:17:58.405
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:17:58.405 --> 03:18:01.732
MATT: So disadvantage on the attack. Are you using
any grit or anything?

03:18:01.732 --> 03:18:18.430
TALIESIN: Not cool! I'm already shaky today. Yeah,
you know what, I'll use a grit to deadeye the

03:18:18.430 --> 03:18:20.305
shot, to cancel out the disadvantage.

03:18:20.305 --> 03:18:22.299
MATT: All right, go ahead and make your roll.

03:18:22.299 --> 03:18:24.526
LAURA: Who are you shooting?

03:18:24.526 --> 03:18:27.015
SAM: The guy on deck who just went like this.

03:18:27.015 --> 03:18:28.775
LAURA: Oh, I thought he already ran under.

03:18:28.775 --> 03:18:34.341
MATT: No, he came up onto the deck to do
something. He barely saw, and he's taking a shot.

03:18:34.341 --> 03:18:37.228
TALIESIN: That's not bad. 24.

03:18:37.228 --> 03:18:38.918
MATT: 24 hits. Go ahead.

03:18:38.918 --> 03:18:40.752
LIAM: Bullet cam!

03:18:40.752 --> 03:18:53.354
TALIESIN: Let me find the correct dice for this.
23 points of piercing damage.

03:18:53.354 --> 03:19:00.973
MATT: The individual reaches up and you see a
burst of electrical energy fire up in the

03:19:00.973 --> 03:19:06.585
direction of both of you. Right as, head shot on
the side of the skull, sending him face down and

03:19:06.585 --> 03:19:12.956
bleeding onto the now raging fire that is the top
of this ship. Both of you guys have advantage on a

03:19:12.956 --> 03:19:14.318
dexterity saving throw.

03:19:14.318 --> 03:19:17.195
MARISHA: Wait, what?

03:19:17.195 --> 03:19:19.299
TALIESIN: He still got a shot off, but it went
wild.

03:19:19.299 --> 03:19:21.718
MARISHA: Natural 20!

03:19:21.718 --> 03:19:23.665
LIAM: And I have a 28.

03:19:23.665 --> 03:19:32.921
MATT: All right. So both of you take 14 points of
lightning damage as the Lightning Bolt barely

03:19:32.921 --> 03:19:38.821
skims past you. Vax, you, scooting off, your wings
burned by the electrical impact, but you're off to

03:19:38.821 --> 03:19:41.156
the side. Keyleth, you're now in freefall over the
ship.

03:19:41.156 --> 03:19:42.349
LIAM: Can I use evasion?

03:19:42.349 --> 03:19:44.177
MATT: Yeah, go for it.

03:19:44.177 --> 03:19:47.263
LIAM: So that's, if I succeed the dex, yeah, it's
every turn.

03:19:47.263 --> 03:19:48.632
MATT: Seven.

03:19:48.632 --> 03:19:49.817
LIAM: It halves it, right?

03:19:49.817 --> 03:19:52.347
MATT: It was 14 because you made the save, and
then seven.

03:19:52.347 --> 03:20:05.895
MARISHA: I blow Vax a kiss and then I go earth
elemental. I light up my flaming hands! And then I

03:20:05.895 --> 03:20:07.251
go Keyteor.

03:20:07.251 --> 03:20:09.488
LIAM: See you later!

03:20:09.488 --> 03:20:17.735
MATT: Your Keyteor, as you coined it, is now this
ball of condensed rock, a trail of flame behind

03:20:17.735 --> 03:20:25.803
it. (whistling) (crashing) Slams into the ship. I
want you to go ahead and roll 6d6 points of

03:20:25.803 --> 03:20:28.740
damage. Plus a d4.

03:20:28.740 --> 03:20:37.755
MARISHA: 6d6. There's got to be one more for this.
Don't fuck me.

03:20:37.755 --> 03:20:43.730
LIAM: How do you even know which ones you rolled?
It looks like 80 dice.

03:20:43.730 --> 03:21:03.940
MARISHA: Well all of them. 21. Plus one. Oh wait.
22, plus do I roll my flame hands?

03:21:03.940 --> 03:21:05.674
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:07.836
MARISHA: 27.

03:21:07.836 --> 03:21:14.064
MATT: Boom! You punch through the upper deck of
the ship, smack through the central deck of the

03:21:14.064 --> 03:21:20.419
ship, and slam into the base, splintering wood,
but the actual bottom of the ship is still intact.

03:21:20.419 --> 03:21:25.528
However, from the impact and everything that's
going on, the flames trail through and begin to

03:21:25.528 --> 03:21:32.048
burn. You see as, looking down at you, one of the
crewmen who was underneath is now a pulp beneath

03:21:32.048 --> 03:21:38.248
your elemental feet. Another one is now scrambling
back up to the top amidst the chaos.

03:21:38.248 --> 03:21:42.506
MARISHA: I get up and I say: Sorry!

03:21:42.506 --> 03:21:48.244
MATT: As you pull your foot out, water begins to
pour inside. Apparently your feet punched through,

03:21:48.244 --> 03:21:53.521
and now it's beginning to quickly (splashing
sounds). Water's beginning to pour out of the

03:21:53.521 --> 03:21:55.095
ocean and fill the bottom of the ship.

03:21:55.095 --> 03:21:57.723
MARISHA: I tell the guys above: Swim to shore!

03:21:57.723 --> 03:22:03.838
MATT: It sounds, (loud gravelly gibberish).
They're like (yelling).

03:22:03.838 --> 03:22:11.911
LAURA: While this is happening, can I have taken a
flying run off of the airship and started flying

03:22:11.911 --> 03:22:13.653
toward the smoke? The campfire?

03:22:13.653 --> 03:22:21.319
MATT: You dart off with the broom underneath and
scoot off toward the bay. You guys have made your

03:22:21.319 --> 03:22:29.550
way, flying down, on eagle-Grog-back to the beach,
coasting up to the side. You can see, as you scoot

03:22:29.550 --> 03:22:34.615
across to the top about ten feet up, all the
jagged, broken glass that is this beach. It is

03:22:34.615 --> 03:22:44.030
similar to the broken, burnt ground of the
Cindergrove, except it's all sharp. It's not fun.

03:22:44.030 --> 03:22:50.850
You come around and make a perception check, Grog.
With your bonus. I think you have advantage on

03:22:50.850 --> 03:22:55.811
this because you're a giant eagle. Let me double
check really fast. I'm pretty sure. Giant eagle,

03:22:55.811 --> 03:22:58.562
you have advantage on perception checks, so yeah,
roll twice.

03:22:58.562 --> 03:23:02.202
TRAVIS: Same number. And do I get a bonus on
the--

03:23:02.202 --> 03:23:03.769
MATT: Well, your wisdom is plus two.

03:23:03.769 --> 03:23:05.291
TRAVIS: 15.

03:23:05.291 --> 03:23:12.919
MATT: 15. As you're coming along, you do see,
there appears to be some semblance of a smoldering

03:23:12.919 --> 03:23:18.739
fire that is giving off a hint of a trail of
smoke. There's a couple of things on the ground

03:23:18.739 --> 03:23:26.164
around it, and there are two small boats that are
up against, up on the shore. They look like little

03:23:26.164 --> 03:23:29.510
skiffs or paddle boats that probably belong to the
ship.

03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:39.484
TRAVIS: I fly over. I'm going to make a low buzz
over the campfire, but keep going along the beach.

03:23:39.484 --> 03:23:41.859
Not landing at the boat or the fire.

03:23:41.859 --> 03:23:48.249
MATT: You keep going. Vex, you see the eagle swoop
past with Scanlan on the back. Are you heading to

03:23:48.249 --> 03:23:49.321
catch up with them?

03:23:49.321 --> 03:23:50.281
LAURA: Yeah.

03:23:50.281 --> 03:23:52.920
MATT: Okay, so you guys have Vex coming and
meeting up alongside you guys now, as you're

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:59.516
flying and coasting. From the side, you see this
broom-riding Vex lean forward, go over and give

03:23:59.516 --> 03:24:04.710
you a wink from the side as you begin heading
along the upper coast, the curvature of the beach,

03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:06.211
heading towards the east.

03:24:06.211 --> 03:24:12.717
TALIESIN: Vax, Keyleth, search the ship. Take
anything you think might be hers.

03:24:12.717 --> 03:24:15.936
LIAM: How far am I from Percival on the airship?

03:24:15.936 --> 03:24:20.962
MATT: You've probably looped around, and you're
probably halfway between the ship, which is now

03:24:20.962 --> 03:24:26.336
heading back toward the shore, and the boat on the
ground that is now, both masts are now in complete

03:24:26.336 --> 03:24:34.536
flames. The sail is on fire. Two of the crewmen,
the two crewmen who haven't really been hurt

03:24:34.536 --> 03:24:38.863
have jumped off the sides and are now swimming
through the water. You can see their trail behind

03:24:38.863 --> 03:24:46.575
them. The one who was shot in the head, you can't
see through the flames. It wasn't enough to kill

03:24:46.575 --> 03:24:51.467
him, that wasn't. However, the whole ship is on
fire now. The one that you impacted with is a

03:24:51.467 --> 03:24:53.469
mess, Keyleth.

03:24:53.469 --> 03:24:55.839
LIAM: Then I'm beelining straight through the air
towards Percival.

03:24:55.839 --> 03:24:58.071
TALIESIN: Stay with Keyleth! Check the ship!

03:24:58.071 --> 03:25:00.064
MARISHA: I crush everything.

03:25:00.064 --> 03:25:02.102
TALIESIN: Search the ship, Keyleth. Search it.

03:25:02.102 --> 03:25:03.290
MATT: Make an investigation check.

03:25:03.290 --> 03:25:04.285
MARISHA: Me?

03:25:04.285 --> 03:25:08.245
MATT: Yeah. You can still hear him, he's telling
you this through your earring.

03:25:08.245 --> 03:25:13.900
TALIESIN: Take the captain's quarters. You can
breathe underwater. Tear it apart as it's going down.

03:25:13.900 --> 03:25:19.461
MATT: As an earth elemental, roll an investigation
minus three because your intelligence is five. You

03:25:19.461 --> 03:25:23.840
are dumber than Grog as an earth elemental.

03:25:23.840 --> 03:25:32.687
MARISHA: Natural 20! There's no reason that should
have happened!

03:25:32.687 --> 03:25:42.803
MATT: I agree! As water is filling the bottom, and
you're not very good at treading water in this

03:25:42.803 --> 03:25:49.364
form. You're sinking with the ship pretty much.
It's (burbling noises). Thankfully you can breathe

03:25:49.364 --> 03:25:54.482
water because you still have the enchantment on
you. Glancing around, you do see what amounts to a

03:25:54.482 --> 03:26:01.714
bunch of notes, papers, that are all soaked in
water, that you palm with your elemental hand. And

03:26:01.714 --> 03:26:06.009
you keep it there, grab a couple, and you now have
two fists filled with papers. You don't know what

03:26:06.009 --> 03:26:12.777
they are or what's on them. You can't even read in
this form, technically, but you're now underwater

03:26:12.777 --> 03:26:17.770
and the ship is breaking and falling. You can
watch as the flames above, the glow is growing

03:26:17.770 --> 03:26:23.448
dimmer as the water is beginning to take the fire.
It's slowly falling into the bay.

03:26:23.448 --> 03:26:27.450
TALIESIN: Start walking to the beach, Keyleth. Get
to the beach.

03:26:27.450 --> 03:26:37.903
MARISHA: Yeah, I guess I start toward the beach.
Well that's going to take a long time. The ship is

03:26:37.903 --> 03:26:39.163
sinking, right?

03:26:39.163 --> 03:26:45.799
MATT: Yeah, you're probably, now, the ship is
probably 30 feet below the surface and falling,

03:26:45.799 --> 03:26:47.004
you with it.

03:26:47.004 --> 03:26:48.426
MARISHA: I'm going to drop my form.

03:26:48.426 --> 03:26:53.077
MATT: Okay, you're back into Keyleth form and
immediately the lack of mass, the ship begins to

03:26:53.077 --> 03:27:01.829
fall below you as you keep buoyancy now. The hole
that you broke through is now this opening that

03:27:01.829 --> 03:27:04.164
you can swim up to get out of the wreckage of the
ship.

03:27:04.164 --> 03:27:08.510
MARISHA: Okay, I take all the papers and I shove
them in a pocket, and I'm going to cast Control

03:27:08.510 --> 03:27:11.402
Water. I'm going to shoot myself up and out.

03:27:11.402 --> 03:27:17.607
MATT: Like a waterspout. You watch as Keyleth is
jettisoned out of the ocean and then begins to

03:27:17.607 --> 03:27:21.704
lightly surf along the surface, standing.

03:27:21.704 --> 03:27:24.190
LAURA: Percy!

03:27:24.190 --> 03:27:25.314
TALIESIN: Yes.

03:27:25.314 --> 03:27:30.329
LAURA: Make sure the airship stays far away from
these boats. I don't want Ripley having any access

03:27:30.329 --> 03:27:31.745
to the airship.

03:27:31.745 --> 03:27:38.762
SAM: On the beach, we're going around, along the
beach. Is there a tree line?

03:27:38.762 --> 03:27:50.151
MATT: The tree line is further inland, maybe about
300 feet inland? Most of the open glass shore is

03:27:50.151 --> 03:27:54.075
on the eastern and southern side. On the north and
northwestern side is where the mountain is, and

03:27:54.075 --> 03:27:57.693
the jungle surrounds most of the mountain, and a
lot of the western side of the island.

03:27:57.693 --> 03:28:03.305
SAM: I shout down to Grog: I don't think she's on
the beach, man! It's all glass! We should go

03:28:03.305 --> 03:28:04.451
inland.

03:28:04.451 --> 03:28:05.881
TRAVIS: We turn inland.

03:28:05.881 --> 03:28:08.337
MATT: Okay, you guys go ahead and take off
inland.

03:28:08.337 --> 03:28:09.809
LIAM: Am I closing on Percy?

03:28:09.809 --> 03:28:14.709
MATT: You're making your way toward the ship,
yeah. The ship is faster than you.

03:28:14.709 --> 03:28:16.069
LIAM: Oh really?

03:28:16.069 --> 03:28:17.103
MATT: Yes.

03:28:17.103 --> 03:28:19.732
LIAM: I click my boots of haste, then. I can go
500 feet in a round.

03:28:19.732 --> 03:28:21.910
MATT: 500 feet?

03:28:21.910 --> 03:28:27.144
LIAM: 480, yeah. If I use double dash, yeah,
action action.

03:28:27.144 --> 03:28:28.918
MATT: Well your flying speed is, what, 60?

03:28:28.918 --> 03:28:36.435
LIAM: I mean, I did the math at one point. I know
it's 480 feet. My speed, flying, is 60.

03:28:36.435 --> 03:28:38.497
MATT: You can dash as a bonus action, right?

03:28:38.497 --> 03:28:43.855
LIAM: As a bonus action, yeah, but if I'm hasted,
it's doubled. So it's 60, it's 120, action,

03:28:43.855 --> 03:28:53.764
action, bonus action, so 120 plus 120, and then
bonus action, I can also dash. I don't know.

03:28:53.764 --> 03:28:58.879
MATT: You can catch up to the ship with haste,
yes. So you click your boots of haste and all of a

03:28:58.879 --> 03:29:06.832
sudden, your wings, the feathers themselves almost
thin out, they retract in. You become less of a

03:29:06.832 --> 03:29:13.218
bird and more of a bullet, coasting forward at a
downward arc. You eventually catch up to the back

03:29:13.218 --> 03:29:21.728
outer side of the airship as it's bearing down on
the smoke spiral and the innermost part of the bay

03:29:21.728 --> 03:29:22.899
beach line.

03:29:22.899 --> 03:29:28.143
LIAM: I'm going to pick you up, you haughty prick!
And I reach out my arms and grab him from behind.

03:29:28.143 --> 03:29:33.215
MATT: Okay. You almost drop Bad News at the sudden
impact, but you grab it and hold on to it as

03:29:33.215 --> 03:29:42.183
you're lifted up again over the air. Another
uncomfortable height experience. You've had a

03:29:42.183 --> 03:29:46.802
couple of these recently. But it's swift enough to
the point, and not prolonged, to the point where

03:29:46.802 --> 03:29:50.128
you're able to keep yourself in check. You begin
to carry him down--

03:29:50.128 --> 03:29:52.119
LIAM: Barrel roll, and follow my sister.

03:29:52.119 --> 03:29:59.247
MATT: Okay, so now all of you guys are this loose
squadron along the beach line. As you watch, they

03:29:59.247 --> 03:30:02.236
turn off and begin to head toward the tree line.

03:30:02.236 --> 03:30:04.917
LAURA: Can I get a closer look at the campsite?

03:30:04.917 --> 03:30:08.486
MATT: You'd probably have to stop and inspect it
if you want.

03:30:08.486 --> 03:30:11.795
LAURA: Is there anybody that I can see around it
from above?

03:30:11.795 --> 03:30:15.139
MATT: Make a perception check.

03:30:15.139 --> 03:30:18.759
LAURA: Yes, 30, then.

03:30:18.759 --> 03:30:26.160
MATT: From what you can see, the campsite, the
fire has the smoldering element that, from your

03:30:26.160 --> 03:30:30.635
experience with campfires, means it's probably
been burning for anywhere from four to five hours

03:30:30.635 --> 03:30:34.741
and is towards the end of its life. Whatever wood
was in there is on the very very last cinders.

03:30:34.741 --> 03:30:41.893
There appear to be some elements in detail, some
heavy movement right around it in the shoreline

03:30:41.893 --> 03:30:47.811
there. There's a little bit of silt that has
washed up onto the glass, so right next to the

03:30:47.811 --> 03:30:54.794
waterline there is still a meeting of underwater
dirt and silt and where the glass begins to take

03:30:54.794 --> 03:31:00.823
over. And you can see a bunch of shifting in that
area, but you're too far away to make out any

03:31:00.823 --> 03:31:06.664
details. But other than that, you don't see any
hint of people or life around that site.

03:31:06.664 --> 03:31:13.106
TRAVIS: Can Scanlan and I make a loop heading
towards the tree line and then stop, I'd say, 100

03:31:13.106 --> 03:31:15.504
feet from where the water hits the shore?

03:31:15.504 --> 03:31:19.669
MATT: Okay, so you head to the tree line and then
you stop about 100 feet out, about halfway between

03:31:19.669 --> 03:31:21.098
the shore and the tree line?

03:31:21.098 --> 03:31:22.210
TRAVIS: Right, yeah, not all the way.

03:31:22.210 --> 03:31:28.608
MATT: You hit there and you end up stopping,
(whooshing) land, and you land in the one area

03:31:28.608 --> 03:31:36.120
where it appears the least painful to land on.
Now, for all intents and purposes, this entire

03:31:36.120 --> 03:31:39.935
landscape is considered rough terrain, so your
speed is halved. You can run full speed if you

03:31:39.935 --> 03:31:41.885
want, but you will take damage in doing so.

03:31:41.885 --> 03:31:43.515
LIAM: Ugh, Lego, it's all made of little Legos!

03:31:43.515 --> 03:31:48.781
MATT: Kind of, yeah. So you land. Scanlan, you're
on the back of Grog and you're now standing in the

03:31:48.781 --> 03:31:51.428
center of this open beach area.

03:31:51.428 --> 03:31:55.163
SAM: I'm scanning around for any footprints or
anything.

03:31:55.163 --> 03:31:56.778
TRAVIS: As he's scanning, I peck him in the
shoulder.

03:31:56.778 --> 03:31:58.243
SAM: Ow, ow! Fuck, ow!

03:31:58.243 --> 03:32:02.109
MARISHA: So we've all convened on the shore at
this point?

03:32:02.109 --> 03:32:08.428
MATT: You see them land a little ways up from the
shore. Vex, are you landing with them?

03:32:08.428 --> 03:32:12.457
LAURA: No, I wanted to fly down a little closer
and see if I can see any footprints, and see where

03:32:12.457 --> 03:32:13.383
they lead.

03:32:13.383 --> 03:32:16.211
MATT: Okay, so you watch Vex spiral off and head
to the actual campsite at the edge of the beach.

03:32:16.211 --> 03:32:19.215
What are you two doing?

03:32:19.215 --> 03:32:20.446
TALIESIN: Keyleth, can you meet up with us?

03:32:20.446 --> 03:32:23.229
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm meeting up with them on the
shore I guess.

03:32:23.229 --> 03:32:25.590
LIAM: I'm a Vax backpack, so we'll just--

03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:27.353
TALIESIN: At the campfire.

03:32:27.353 --> 03:32:34.276
MATT: So you guys (whooshing) come down and land
at the campfire as you watch Keyleth water-skiing

03:32:34.276 --> 03:32:40.831
right up to the edge of the beach, where, as soon
as the water ends, you have to catch yourself, but

03:32:40.831 --> 03:32:50.022
you catch yourself. As you now stand here at the
beach, the little hint of the flaming wreckage of

03:32:50.022 --> 03:32:57.306
the ship in the distance finally sinking below the
surface of the water; the gallant eagle, Grog,

03:32:57.306 --> 03:33:04.412
standing off a little ways, with Scanlan Shorthalt
raising a fist to the air; we're going to end our

03:33:04.412 --> 03:33:09.348
session for today. Give us some fun to explore
next episode.

03:33:09.348 --> 03:33:11.757
MARISHA: But there was so much more to do!

03:33:11.757 --> 03:33:17.075
TALIESIN: I am having such a Robert Louis
Stevenson moment right now. I'm so excited.

03:33:17.075 --> 03:33:18.711
SAM: We finished before eleven!

03:33:18.711 --> 03:33:19.987
TALIESIN: No we did not!

03:33:19.987 --> 03:33:24.329
MATT: Yes we did! I intended that because we've
gone long a lot of weeks!

03:33:24.329 --> 03:33:29.579
TALIESIN: I cannot imagine that I might actually
get four hours of sleep tonight. That's amazing.

03:33:29.579 --> 03:33:37.528
MATT: I'm going to write more campaign setting.
Guys, awesome episode, well done.

03:33:37.528 --> 03:33:39.196
LIAM: That was a great game, Matt.

03:33:39.196 --> 03:33:41.302
MATT: Good stuff, guys.

03:33:41.302 --> 03:33:43.810
TRAVIS: Thank you to our sponsor, Backblaze!

03:33:43.810 --> 03:33:48.362
SAM: Did they run a commercial during the break?

03:33:48.362 --> 03:33:50.910
LAURA: I hope so, because I love those
commercials.

03:33:50.910 --> 03:33:55.487
TRAVIS: Those commercials are fucking hilarious.

03:33:55.487 --> 03:34:01.119
MATT: All right, guys, well, thank you very much,
rest well, you guys as well. Thank you so much for

03:34:01.119 --> 03:34:04.107
all your awesome support in watching the show. We
appreciate everything, and--

03:34:04.107 --> 03:34:08.570
TRAVIS: And next Thursday you can see us at Game
the Game the hour beforehand.

03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:15.905
MATT: Game the Game, 5:30 to 6:30, going into our
next episode of Critical Role and have a good

03:34:15.905 --> 03:34:18.282
night. Is it Thursday yet?

03:34:18.282 --> 03:43:09.081
