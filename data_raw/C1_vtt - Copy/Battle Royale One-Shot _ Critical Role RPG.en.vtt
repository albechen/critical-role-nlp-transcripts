(laughing)

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.101
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome to tonight's
episode of Critical Role! Where a bunch of us

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:09.617
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around, play Dungeons
and Dragons, and shout obscenities a little late.

00:00:09.617 --> 00:00:13.079
LAURA: Did it make it?

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.820
MATT: We'll find out, I'm sure.

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:15.976
LAURA: We'll find out.

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:19.356
MATT: Anyway, glad you guys could join us for
tonight. Tonight is not a typical episode, we are

00:00:19.356 --> 00:00:22.635
missing two of our cast members, and since we're
in the throes of an interesting narrative, we

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.890
wanted to push that off for a week. Next week we
return with Vox Machina's normal narrative as well

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.509
as Jon Heder as a guest, which is going to be a
lot of fun!

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.226
(cheering)

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:35.875
MATT: However, this week, for the five members
that we do have, we are going to have a

00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:41.846
fantastical Battle Royale. A Level 17 Battle
Royale. The power level has definitely jumped

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:47.414
since the last time we had one of these, I'm
curious to see how it pans out. Should be fun.

00:00:47.477 --> 00:00:51.688
LAURA: By the way, I saw voting-- there was a poll
to see who they thought would win.

00:00:51.688 --> 00:00:55.094
MATT: Don't say anything yet! Hold off on that.
Hold off on that.

00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:56.494
LAURA: Okay.

00:00:56.494 --> 00:00:58.864
MARISHA: I wonder how many people are going to
lose money on us tonight.

00:00:58.864 --> 00:01:04.360
SAM: Travis, you have something-- yes, right,
right there.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.410
TRAVIS: Where? Right here?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.306
SAM: Yeah, right there. There's a little
something.

00:01:07.306 --> 00:01:08.282
TRAVIS: Did I get it?

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:09.610
SAM: Yup.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:18.498
MATT: Anyway. So yeah, so real fast, just to get
through our brief announcements for the day. Me,

00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:23.568
Marisha, Taliesin, and Brian Foster will be flying
out tomorrow, early, to Atlanta to join you guys

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:26.554
at MomoCon. We've been talking about it for a few
weeks here. We have a Talks Machina panel on

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.268
Saturday. Signings. Other fun events, so please
come join us if you're going to be out in that

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:39.501
vicinity. Next week after that a bunch of us are
going to be at the Stream of Annihilation, a

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:44.730
stream up at Seattle with the D&amp;D folks, along
with a bunch of other awesome D&amp;D groups and

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:52.592
streamers, High Rollers guys. We've got Curse of Strahd
folk. A bunch of just really awesome people coming

00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:56.678
up. We're going to be playing with some folks, I
might be running a game, it will be fun. But look

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.002
forward to seeing you guys there. Check us out.
We'll have more information to come out soon. Then

00:02:01.002 --> 00:02:03.067
the week after that, I'm going to be at A-Kon in
Dallas.

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.367
Because I apparently don't like having
weekends.

00:02:05.367 --> 00:02:07.197
TRAVIS: Are you allergic?

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:12.533
MATT: I need to work on that. Planning is a
problem, it catches up to you. But anyway, I'll be

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:17.183
out there for that in Dallas, Texas. Hope to see
you guys that weekend. What else? What else do

00:02:17.183 --> 00:02:19.052
people want to talk about?

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:23.541
TALIESIN: I think we're going to have our
Wednesday Club this Wednesday. I think we're going

00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:26.496
to do Wonder Woman. We were having a straw poll,
where I think we're going to be talking about

00:02:26.496 --> 00:02:27.874
Wonder Woman.

00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:29.914
TRAVIS: That's kind of irrelevant right now, right?

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:35.401
TALIESIN: Yeah, we don't normally veer relevant,
but we figure this is kind of a big deal so, you

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.784
know, and it's an interesting conversation.

00:02:37.784 --> 00:02:40.447
SAM: Have you ever done an episode about Groo the
Wanderer?

00:02:40.447 --> 00:02:44.405
TALIESIN: No, but I know of Groo. We don't know
Groo well enough to really delve in.

00:02:44.405 --> 00:02:47.402
SAM: If you do an episode on Groo, that's the one
I'll watch.

00:02:47.402 --> 00:02:49.379
TALIESIN: Not the one you'll be on?

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:51.100
SAM: No, no, no. I'll watch it, though.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.108
TALIESIN: You'll watch it, then?

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.717
SAM: Yeah, yeah. I'm not going to go on your show.

00:02:53.717 --> 00:02:54.591
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.150
(laughter)

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.673
SAM: I could bring my comic collection on your
show! And show it off!

00:02:58.673 --> 00:03:00.473
TRAVIS: You have a comic collection?

00:03:00.473 --> 00:03:01.896
SAM: Yeah, man!

00:03:01.896 --> 00:03:03.363
TRAVIS: More than ten? More than ten comics?

00:03:03.363 --> 00:03:04.950
SAM: Yeah, I've got some good books, man.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.056
TALIESIN: You gave me that really good comic book
for-- was it Christmas last year? Or the year

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:11.016
before, because I read it in Colorado, it was
really nice.

00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:12.415
MATT: Save your rolls, Laura.

00:03:12.415 --> 00:03:13.612
LAURA: I had to test it!

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:15.016
MATT: I know. I know you do.

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:16.666
LAURA: That was the Joe-dice.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:18.284
MATT: Oh! There you go!

00:03:18.284 --> 00:03:20.376
LAURA: He's making it into the battle.

00:03:20.376 --> 00:03:22.933
MATT: There you go. You need to know who's in your
corner, Laura.

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:24.484
LAURA: That's right.

00:03:24.484 --> 00:03:30.480
MATT: All righty, guys. If we don't have anything
else to discuss, we're going to go ahead and dive

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:37.517
into tonight's episode of Critical Role.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:05:03.382
[dramatic music]

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:09.368
MATT: All right, and welcome back, everybody! So
as part of tonight's Battle Royale, a couple of

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.695
things that I want to put out there. One: because
we're at higher power levels, it may go quickly.

00:05:15.695 --> 00:05:24.160
If it goes quickly, we may do a second round.
Which, keep in mind, whatever alliances or

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.649
betrayals you endure that first round will
probably be remembered for the second.

00:05:28.649 --> 00:05:31.304
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait! Were we supposed to make
alliances?!

00:05:31.304 --> 00:05:33.920
SAM: Oh yeah, we all made alliances. We all made
alliances, Laura.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.544
(laughter)

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:38.680
SAM: It's all four of us against you.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.227
TRAVIS: Yeah, raise your hand if you're on Team
Right.

00:05:41.227 --> 00:05:42.586
MARISHA: Table Right!

00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:44.081
MATT: Laura, have you played Risk?

00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:45.240
LAURA: Yes.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.708
MATT: Risk is a game where you make alliances and
then double-cross people. It doesn't say it in the

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:56.018
rules, but that's how it always happens. That's
what I assume will probably happen. It may not!

00:05:56.018 --> 00:05:59.805
You guys may surprise me! I'm just saying, be
prepared.

00:05:59.805 --> 00:06:02.570
LAURA and TRAVIS: (singing) Be prepared!

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.865
MATT: (laughing) Okay, now I'm voting for that
table! All right, guys, the other thing I want to

00:06:08.865 --> 00:06:14.646
mention is, whoever the victor is will get a minor
prize. A very, very minor prize.

00:06:14.646 --> 00:06:18.247
LAURA: What is it?! Do we get to know what it is?

00:06:18.247 --> 00:06:20.301
TALIESIN: A Nintendo Switch!

00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:28.080
MATT: PlayStation 2. No. You will get a fate die
that you get to carry over

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.291
into the main campaign.

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:31.573
It's a single reroll.

00:06:31.635 --> 00:06:34.340
SAM: That could come in handy.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.140
MATT: It's like a Luck point.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.123
TRAVIS: Well fuck! No! My lighthearted self is now
changed!

00:06:39.123 --> 00:06:43.735
LAURA: You already have fate dice! You have a
fucking Deck of Many Things. You have an entire

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:45.397
plethora of fate dice.

00:06:45.397 --> 00:06:49.053
TRAVIS: That is not the same. There's like a seven
percent chance I even pull

00:06:49.053 --> 00:06:50.653
something even close to that.

00:06:50.653 --> 00:06:53.599
TALIESIN: I'm with Travis on this one. It's just
not the same. No.

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.317
TRAVIS: That's a big prize!

00:06:55.317 --> 00:06:59.479
LAURA: Enjoy the fate die, Keyleth or Grog.

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:03.712
TRAVIS: Yeah, like when you choose to become a
goldfish from a thousand feet.

00:07:03.712 --> 00:07:07.581
MARISHA: Yeah, that would have been great. To have
then. Mm-hm. So clutch.

00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:12.070
TALIESIN: Is this your first Battle Royale? So,
what happens though, is that the people who are

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.572
obviously the problem often get targeted first.
And then it'll be other people who somehow have

00:07:17.619 --> 00:07:19.938
all their hit points in Round Four.

00:07:19.938 --> 00:07:24.139
SAM: Oh, that's happening, guys. You're going to
forget I existed.

00:07:24.139 --> 00:07:28.498
MARISHA: Mr. Loot-Drop over here.

00:07:28.498 --> 00:07:32.411
TALIESIN: Mr. Loot-Drop may go down early.

00:07:32.411 --> 00:07:36.389
TRAVIS: Mr. Care-Package.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:44.559
MATT: As you all comfortably find yourself
resting, falling into sleep and darkness for the

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:53.653
evening, in the city of Whitestone, over some
point in the break of the year-long period. You

00:07:53.653 --> 00:07:58.178
find yourself-- Your eyes opening; bleary,
blinking, towards what appears to be a grey

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:03.988
cloud-covered sky. You look about and find
yourselves somewhat scattered amongst an

00:08:03.988 --> 00:08:10.351
unfamiliar battlefield. Travis, I want you to go
ahead and roll a d6 for me, please.

00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:12.563
TRAVIS: Oh God. Okay!

00:08:12.563 --> 00:08:15.694
LAURA: This is serious! This is serious!

00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:17.070
TRAVIS: A two.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:19.390
MATT: A two. Okay.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:23.144
LAURA: Oh my God! I was just looking at the
top-view, I didn't realize that

00:08:23.144 --> 00:08:25.515
those are fucking towers!

00:08:25.515 --> 00:08:27.535
MATT: Yeah, so that's you there.

00:08:27.535 --> 00:08:29.018
TRAVIS: Okay. Okay.

00:08:29.018 --> 00:08:31.261
MATT: Laura. Go ahead and roll a d6.

00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:34.453
LAURA: (panting) Okay! Six!

00:08:34.453 --> 00:08:41.367
MATT: A six! With Trinket there.

00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:43.230
LAURA: Oh God. Oh, with Trinket up there!

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:45.793
MARISHA: Exactly where the ranger should be.

00:08:45.793 --> 00:08:49.956
MATT: All right, Marisha, roll a d6.

00:08:49.956 --> 00:08:53.670
SAM: First roll of the night!

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.107
MARISHA: Four.

00:08:55.107 --> 00:09:03.199
MATT: Four. All righty. Taliesin?

00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:05.139
TALIESIN: Four.

00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:06.657
MATT: Roll again.

00:09:06.657 --> 00:09:09.097
TALIESIN: Three.

00:09:09.097 --> 00:09:15.137
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a d6.

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:16.429
SAM: One.

00:09:16.429 --> 00:09:20.202
LAURA: Look at us, spreading out our numbers!

00:09:20.202 --> 00:09:32.927
MATT: All righty, so as you take in the scenery
around you, seemingly no rhyme or reason. You

00:09:32.927 --> 00:09:38.663
wonder how you transported to this space. Taryon
in particular, you find that you seem to be a

00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:45.262
little more viable power than you were when you
went to bed that night. You watch as a singular

00:09:45.262 --> 00:09:52.843
cloaked figure seems to emerge from the clouds
above you and slowly fall from the sky. As the

00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:59.755
entity, you see arms out, hood up, the wind
blowing around causing the cloth to flap and curl

00:09:59.755 --> 00:10:02.941
about them. The hood blows back, and you see
before you, a--

00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:04.555
SAM: It's me, Vax.

00:10:04.555 --> 00:10:07.025
(laughter)

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:14.582
SAM: Hey everybody, I can fly 200,000 feet in one
second.

00:10:14.582 --> 00:10:22.669
MATT: So, if we ever do a live-action Vox Machina
film, we get Owen Wilson to play Vax. So, as the

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:27.438
figure descends to about this point in the center
of the battlefield, you watch as the wind blows the

00:10:27.438 --> 00:10:34.492
hood back, and you see there a handsome man with
immaculate, somewhat ear-length brown hair, and a

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:42.488
magnificent beard. As he smiles and looks around
and goes: "Tonight, you fight for me and my

00:10:42.488 --> 00:10:48.059
"pleasure. For I am the forgotten deity, known as
Colville!"

00:10:48.059 --> 00:10:54.421
(laughter)

00:10:54.421 --> 00:10:58.536
MATT: "And you will dance before me. And between
you all, one victor shall stand and gain my

00:10:58.536 --> 00:11:08.167
"blessing." At which point, he raises his hand, and
you watch as a force field of energy suddenly

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:14.532
(whoosh) warps around and encapsulates around it,
also zeroing off the top about there. So there is

00:11:14.532 --> 00:11:21.742
a height limit to this chamber. Right across
there. About 20 feet up

00:11:21.742 --> 00:11:24.540
from the base of this tower.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.755
SAM: Which are 30 feet tall, 20 feet tall?

00:11:26.755 --> 00:11:28.392
MATT: These are 30 feet tall.

00:11:28.392 --> 00:11:29.895
MARISHA: So about 50 feet up.

00:11:29.895 --> 00:11:38.885
MATT: 50 feet up, yeah. You watch as he grins and
smiles. "I hope you all learn something. Now, you

00:11:38.931 --> 00:11:46.506
"have six seconds to decide where to go and what to
prepare for. No fighting is to commence until

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:52.158
"these six seconds are up. And then... Show me what
you've got!"

00:11:52.158 --> 00:11:55.061
(laughter)

00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:57.330
LAURA: So wait, we can cast things in these six
seconds?

00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.602
MATT: You can cast or prepare anything you want
to, an action or movement or bonus, that doesn't

00:12:01.602 --> 00:12:06.682
attack or assault another person, for the first
round, but first! Let's roll initiative, guys.

00:12:06.682 --> 00:12:08.694
LAURA: Oh my gosh!

00:12:08.694 --> 00:12:10.228
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:12:10.228 --> 00:12:13.221
SAM: I'm feeling lucky? That's terrible.

00:12:13.294 --> 00:12:15.832
MATT: All righty.

00:12:15.832 --> 00:12:17.588
SAM: That's one Luck down.

00:12:17.588 --> 00:12:19.599
MATT: So, 25 to 20?

00:12:19.599 --> 00:12:21.270
TALIESIN: 29.

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:24.901
TRAVIS: What the fuck, man?

00:12:24.901 --> 00:12:29.551
TALIESIN: Ain't gonna have a repeat of last
time.

00:12:29.598 --> 00:12:31.871
MATT: All righty. (laughs) That's right, yeah.

00:12:31.871 --> 00:12:34.973
TALIESIN: I was just low enough, if I had been
above Liam, that would have been the end of him,

00:12:34.973 --> 00:12:36.749
but he hid.

00:12:36.749 --> 00:12:38.844
MATT: All right. 20 to 15?

00:12:38.844 --> 00:12:39.889
LAURA: 19.

00:12:39.889 --> 00:12:40.818
TRAVIS: 16.

00:12:40.818 --> 00:12:41.987
MARISHA: 16.

00:12:41.987 --> 00:12:49.051
MATT: Okay. Vex, and then Keyleth and Grog.
Interesting.

00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:51.048
SAM: You need a tie breaker?

00:12:51.048 --> 00:12:56.544
MATT: I think so. I'll have you guys both roll
dexterity checks for me, please. Just roll a d20--

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.564
TRAVIS: Just normal dex rolls? Or just straight
up?

00:12:58.564 --> 00:13:00.264
MATT: Just roll a d20, and add your dex modifier.

00:13:00.264 --> 00:13:03.009
TRAVIS: Okay. 20.

00:13:03.009 --> 00:13:04.421
MARISHA: Four.

00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:14.891
MATT: So we have Vex, then Grog-Keyleth! All
righty, and then Tary!

00:13:14.891 --> 00:13:16.799
SAM: Oh, sorry, nine.

00:13:16.799 --> 00:13:19.783
MATT: All righty. Which, by the way, you also
have--

00:13:19.783 --> 00:13:20.990
SAM: Doty!

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:23.067
MATT: Doty at your disposal at the top.

00:13:23.067 --> 00:13:24.218
SAM: Yes.

00:13:24.218 --> 00:13:25.549
MARISHA: Are you at the top of the tower too?

00:13:25.549 --> 00:13:27.371
SAM: I'm on that tower. She's on the other tower.

00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:32.784
LAURA: Wait a minute, here's my question. Did we
see where everybody landed? Could we see

00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:37.679
everybody, when we came down? Or did we just see
the guy?

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:41.286
MATT: You guys just saw the guy, and you just got
your vision around, so this round is going to be

00:13:41.286 --> 00:13:47.134
running and taking in your surroundings, and doing
what you're going to do to prepare. From where you

00:13:47.134 --> 00:13:52.308
are right now, you can barely see somebody. We'll
say as part of this round,

00:13:52.308 --> 00:13:54.525
you guys get a feel for it.

00:13:54.525 --> 00:13:55.857
MARISHA: As part of this round we what?

00:13:55.857 --> 00:13:59.219
MATT: You get a feel for where everyone else is,
as part of this first round.

00:13:59.219 --> 00:14:02.795
TRAVIS: On the towers, on the far ends of the map,
is there a back entrance to the tower,

00:14:02.795 --> 00:14:03.995
or just the door?

00:14:03.995 --> 00:14:08.160
MATT: Just the doors there, or climbing upward, and
there appears to be a trapdoor on either side.

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:09.443
TRAVIS: Going up?

00:14:09.443 --> 00:14:12.317
MATT: There's a ladder, ladder, and a chain.

00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:16.996
LAURA: When he said you have six seconds, I
immediately duck down and cast Pass Without a

00:14:16.996 --> 00:14:18.750
Trace on myself and Trinket.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:21.408
MATT: Okay, so, we'll get to your turn; Percival,
you're up first.

00:14:21.408 --> 00:14:28.819
TALIESIN: I'm going to activate the Boots of
Spider Climbing. Should knock that out. I'm going

00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:34.706
to charge Diplomacy. And then I'm going to--

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:36.372
TRAVIS: Can't hide.

00:14:36.372 --> 00:14:38.707
SAM: What, is that a rule?

00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:40.881
TRAVIS: No, I'm just talking shit.

00:14:40.881 --> 00:14:42.414
TALIESIN: I ain't hiding.

00:14:42.414 --> 00:14:44.593
SAM: I'm hiding.

00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:49.764
TALISIN: I'm going to climb up to the top of that
building that's right over there.

00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:51.409
MATT: Which one? This one?

00:14:51.409 --> 00:14:52.951
TALIESIN: That little hut.

00:14:52.951 --> 00:14:54.438
MATT: Okay, so you climb up.

00:14:54.438 --> 00:14:55.654
MARISHA: Is that a hut, is that what those are?

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:59.993
MATT: They're little stone bunker-like
structures. There's an entrance on this side and

00:15:00.053 --> 00:15:01.532
on this side.

00:15:01.532 --> 00:15:03.015
MARISHA: Shit.

00:15:03.015 --> 00:15:07.061
TALIESIN: Actually, how far-- I have a--
(counting) six, one, two, three, four, five--

00:15:07.061 --> 00:15:08.502
MARISHA: It's like a paintball arena.

00:15:08.559 --> 00:15:13.150
MATT: So, it's half your movement, that's 15 feet,
you can move 15 more feet if you want to.

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:18.146
TALIESIN: Yeah, let me get just one step back or
so.

00:15:18.146 --> 00:15:19.447
MATT: There?

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:22.591
TALIESIN: Still at the edge, on the other side,
though. To your right.

00:15:22.591 --> 00:15:25.661
MATT: Okay, here? Okay. So there you are.

00:15:25.661 --> 00:15:28.358
TALIESIN: Yeah, and boots are activated, Diplomacy
is activated.

00:15:28.358 --> 00:15:32.730
MATT: Boots are activated, Diplomacy is activated.
Perfect. All right. Just after Percy goes, you

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:40.168
watch as all the flickering braziers, the flames
flicker bright. You see these two glowing towers

00:15:40.168 --> 00:15:44.337
that are slowly spinning, the blue crystals
(crackling noises) little sparks. And each of

00:15:44.337 --> 00:15:49.245
these pillars gives off a slight hum. Vex, it's
your turn.

00:15:49.245 --> 00:15:55.051
LAURA: It's like a trapped thing? This is so
Hunger Games. Oh shit! Okay. I'm going to cast

00:15:55.051 --> 00:15:59.508
Pass Without a Trace on me and Trinket. And I'm
going to send him down-- Is there a trapdoor or

00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:01.838
like a stairway around? That he can go down?

00:16:01.838 --> 00:16:03.830
MATT: There is a trapdoor that he can go down and
then make his way.

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:07.855
LAURA: He's going to make his way down. But I am
going to hide, at the top here,

00:16:07.855 --> 00:16:09.296
behind one of those--

00:16:09.296 --> 00:16:14.337
MATT: Behind one of those? Okay. Go ahead and make
a stealth check. And Trinket makes it-- We'll say

00:16:14.337 --> 00:16:20.699
halfway down the tunnel with Trinket's full
movement, there. So down the stairs and he's

00:16:20.741 --> 00:16:23.050
halfway through the tower there.

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.108
LAURA: So my stealth is 30.

00:16:25.108 --> 00:16:29.779
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Nobody else has any idea
where you are right now.

00:16:29.779 --> 00:16:30.650
LAURA: Solid.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:36.437
MATT: At the moment. All right, that brings us to
Grog.

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:45.686
TRAVIS: (grunts) I would like to rage! Just, oh,
so angry! I don't like people putting me in

00:16:45.686 --> 00:17:03.825
strange places and floating down from the clouds,
&lt;i&gt;Colville.&lt;/i&gt; Can I equip-- yeah, fuck it. Fuck it.

00:17:03.869 --> 00:17:07.489
I'm going to stick with the Bloodaxe. Not the
Dwarven Thrower.

00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:09.399
MATT: Okay, Bloodaxe. Oof.

00:17:09.399 --> 00:17:16.705
TRAVIS: I know. I know. That might be a poor
choice. Oh, you motherfuckers can fly!

00:17:16.705 --> 00:17:18.340
TALIESIN: I can't.

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:21.604
TRAVIS: Bullshit, you're climbing up shit with
spider boots. You know what, no, Dwarven Thrower.

00:17:21.647 --> 00:17:26.237
Dwarven Thrower, and can I start to climb the
little rope ladder that's next to me?

00:17:26.237 --> 00:17:28.133
MATT: Yes, you can, make an athletics check.

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:38.994
TRAVIS: I just want to get a good lay of the land!
I don't even know anybody's up there! 15.

00:17:38.994 --> 00:17:41.027
SAM: The glasses are clutch.

00:17:41.027 --> 00:17:44.340
MATT: You rage, get up, and just crest over the
top.

00:17:44.409 --> 00:17:46.446
LAURA: Oh shit, you're already there!

00:17:46.446 --> 00:17:54.109
SAM: (screaming) He sleeps in war paint?! Why would
he sleep in war paint?!

00:17:54.167 --> 00:17:59.666
MATT: He rage-climbs the ladder. One rung over the
other, and with the rest of his movement gets to

00:17:59.666 --> 00:18:00.997
the very top of the tower.

00:18:01.058 --> 00:18:02.781
TRAVIS: Do I have a bonus action?

00:18:02.835 --> 00:18:04.647
MATT: Well, your bonus action was rage.

00:18:04.828 --> 00:18:06.743
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, never mind.

00:18:06.743 --> 00:18:09.546
MATT: If you have an action you want to do that
doesn't involve attacking or hurting anybody--

00:18:09.594 --> 00:18:11.491
TRAVIS: I blow a snot rocket when I get to the
top.

00:18:11.491 --> 00:18:16.995
MATT: Okay. You watch as a large globule of
goliath snot slaps the ground in front of you, and

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.313
skids a bit, leaving a trail.

00:18:18.313 --> 00:18:20.693
SAM: Oh, man.

00:18:20.693 --> 00:18:21.668
TRAVIS: Dexterity check.

00:18:21.668 --> 00:18:23.185
SAM: It's like a cicada.

00:18:23.245 --> 00:18:27.712
(laughter)

00:18:27.763 --> 00:18:30.760
MATT: All right. Is that your turn, Grog? Keyleth,
you're up.

00:18:30.815 --> 00:18:41.332
MARISHA: Oh, god. It begins. Can I just run up,
and just check that water right in front of me?

00:18:41.332 --> 00:18:46.509
And really fast, put my foot in it and see if I
can see how deep it goes?

00:18:46.509 --> 00:18:47.776
LAURA: And you die.

00:18:47.776 --> 00:18:50.261
TRAVIS: No, no, let her do it.

00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:53.475
MARISHA: Let me take my staff. And just put my
staff down a little bit.

00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:59.867
MATT: Okay. Your staff dips down and it goes
about-- It keeps going. It's pretty deep.

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:01.166
MARISHA: It's pretty deep?

00:19:01.166 --> 00:19:03.715
MATT: To the point where you get, like, to the very
edge of your staff, holding it there, and it

00:19:03.995 --> 00:19:06.235
manages to go all the way in.

00:19:06.304 --> 00:19:08.091
MARISHA: Oh, I touch the bottom now, though?

00:19:08.091 --> 00:19:11.241
MATT: Yeah. Well, you haven't felt the bottom yet,
any more and you're

00:19:11.241 --> 00:19:13.541
going to submerge your hands.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:18.715
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to cast Freedom of
Movement on myself. And then can I move around to

00:19:18.715 --> 00:19:26.161
this side, here-ish? This side here-ish. Over
here. And hide.

00:19:26.161 --> 00:19:31.670
MATT: And move over this way? Well, you're not
hiding, you don't have anything left to do a hide

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:32.979
action, but you move there.

00:19:32.979 --> 00:19:33.800
MARISHA: That's fine.

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.895
MATT: Okay. All right. So, Taryon.

00:19:36.895 --> 00:19:38.386
SAM: Everyone else has gone?

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.508
MATT: Yeah.

00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:40.909
SAM: I have a lot to do.

00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:42.019
MATT: All right, what are you doing?

00:19:42.019 --> 00:19:44.296
SAM: Number one, how much does Doty weigh?

00:19:44.296 --> 00:19:49.750
MATT: At his size, I'd say he weighs somewhere in
the range of 700 pounds.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.746
SAM: Fuck. That changes things.

00:19:52.746 --> 00:19:57.202
MATT: He is somewhat hollow in places, though.

00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:59.449
TRAVIS: Build him out of aluminium?

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:05.849
MATT: No. He's large and he's heavy, metallic
substances, but he is hollow in places, so I'd

00:20:05.849 --> 00:20:09.337
actually say he's probably closer to 500 maybe.
400 to 500.

00:20:09.337 --> 00:20:21.528
SAM: Still, anything over 400 bones my strategy so
it's okay. We're okay. Plan number two. Okay. I

00:20:21.528 --> 00:20:30.990
say, Doty! I need you to carry me away from all
the bad people. Remember how we played keep-away

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:35.415
as children? We're playing that now. Keep me away
from everybody.

00:20:35.415 --> 00:20:37.182
MATT: "Tary."

00:20:37.182 --> 00:20:46.254
SAM: Yes. I cast Sanctuary on Doty. I think I can
do that. Yeah? Okay. And then for my action I will

00:20:46.254 --> 00:20:52.369
throw down the Bead of Force on myself and enclose
myself in the bubble.

00:20:52.369 --> 00:20:57.905
MARISHA: You're going to be a guy in a hamster
ball being carried around by robot?

00:20:57.905 --> 00:21:00.004
SAM: I take 5d4 damage.

00:21:00.004 --> 00:21:01.444
LAURA: That's pretty smart.

00:21:01.444 --> 00:21:02.537
MARISHA: It's pretty awesome.

00:21:02.537 --> 00:21:03.768
TRAVIS: You take 5d4 damage?

00:21:03.768 --> 00:21:05.464
LAURA: Just putting yourself in the ball?

00:21:05.464 --> 00:21:06.689
SAM: Uh-huh.

00:21:06.689 --> 00:21:09.958
LAURA: That's smart, you know what? And then we
can't hurt you.

00:21:09.958 --> 00:21:11.768
SAM: Not for a minute.

00:21:11.768 --> 00:21:13.068
LAURA: Oh shit!

00:21:13.068 --> 00:21:16.790
SAM: I got ten rounds, y'all. See ya!

00:21:16.838 --> 00:21:19.521
MARISHA: Is it totally invulnerable type of shit?

00:21:19.521 --> 00:21:20.679
SAM: Yes.

00:21:20.679 --> 00:21:23.118
LAURA: Unless somebody can dispel it or
something?

00:21:23.118 --> 00:21:26.468
MATT: Only breathable air can pass through the
sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.

00:21:26.468 --> 00:21:36.671
SAM: It says no magic can pass within or without
the space, it doesn't say that I can't do magic in

00:21:36.671 --> 00:21:39.682
the sphere, it just says it can't leave the
sphere.

00:21:39.682 --> 00:21:44.300
MATT: Correct. So you can cast things on yourself
within, but nothing can pass by. However, you are

00:21:44.352 --> 00:21:48.132
at the mercy of whoever has control of the ball at
the moment. So yes.

00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:50.502
MARISHA: So wait, but you can't cast spells out
either?

00:21:50.502 --> 00:21:53.334
TRAVIS: You ever see those sporting events where
the beach ball's just going

00:21:53.363 --> 00:21:54.748
around the fucking crowd?

00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:57.753
LAURA: So wait. Only air can pass through it,
huh?

00:21:57.753 --> 00:22:01.085
SAM: Breathable air. Not poison air.

00:22:01.085 --> 00:22:05.695
MARISHA: If I was an air elemental, could I go
into the sphere? Just conjecturing.

00:22:05.695 --> 00:22:09.043
MATT: I don't know if you're considered breathable
as an air elemental.

00:22:09.043 --> 00:22:13.750
MARISHA: Yeah. But I'm a breath of fresh air.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:19.387
MATT: Taryon, as you slam into the ground, how
much damage do you take?

00:22:19.387 --> 00:22:27.282
SAM: I'll roll. Six, seven, eight. Nine points of
damage.

00:22:27.282 --> 00:22:31.271
MATT: That's not too bad. You take nine points of
damage, and the sphere encapsulates you and you

00:22:31.271 --> 00:22:41.888
begin to roll forward slightly as Doty walks over,
grabs you, and pulls you back about there to the

00:22:41.888 --> 00:22:45.073
edge. Not sure what to do, he's just holding you
now in this ball.

00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:46.505
SAM: Sure.

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:57.239
MATT: "Tary?" Confused. All right. At the end of
that turn, you watch over as Colville, floating in

00:22:57.239 --> 00:23:05.847
the center, goes, "And now, my champions! Let the
fight begin!" Slams his hands together and you watch

00:23:05.847 --> 00:23:14.770
him vanish in a burst of thunder as it cracks
around the landscape. And you feel this energy

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.873
pulse you all at once as the battle has begun.
Percival, you're up first.

00:23:18.873 --> 00:23:20.584
TALIESIN: Who can I see?

00:23:20.584 --> 00:23:24.245
SAM: Grog's head.

00:23:24.245 --> 00:23:30.948
MATT: You can barely see part of Grog with
three-quarters cover. Barely.

00:23:30.948 --> 00:23:33.142
TALIESIN: I can barely see Grog with
three-quarters cover.

00:23:33.142 --> 00:23:37.437
MATT: Everyone else looks apparently at the moment
not really in your line of sight.

00:23:37.437 --> 00:23:41.697
TALIESIN: That's fine. That's my first shot then.
Let's just take a couple shots at Grog.

00:23:41.697 --> 00:23:43.091
MATT: Okay.

00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:50.907
TALIESIN: You know, if you hadn't made it all the way
up that tower you'd be in intense trouble right

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.557
now. Okay, just pointing that out.

00:23:53.557 --> 00:23:55.128
MATT: You have Sharpshooter, so you ignore
three-quarters cover.

00:23:55.128 --> 00:24:03.975
TALIESIN: Yeah, I ignore three-quarters-- Let's do
first shot with Animus. That's a 29 to hit.

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.625
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that hits.

00:24:05.625 --> 00:24:08.647
TALIESIN: That hits? All right. Let's just roll
all three first.

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:10.191
MATT: Go for it, yeah.

00:24:10.191 --> 00:24:15.338
TALIESIN: Oh! No. And then the second one is a
misfire.

00:24:15.338 --> 00:24:17.666
LAURA, MARISHA: Oh my God!

00:24:17.666 --> 00:24:19.195
TRAVIS: Like, gun-break misfire?

00:24:19.195 --> 00:24:27.485
TALIESIN: Gun-break misfire. It's gun-break
misfire. That's okay. Yeah, so I'll just take my

00:24:27.485 --> 00:24:31.029
third shot with Bad News. Just for fun.

00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:33.830
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:36.442
TALIESIN: 20 to hit.

00:24:36.442 --> 00:24:40.610
MATT: Yeah, that hits. All right, so-- One Animus
shot, and then one Bad News shot.

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:43.623
TALIESIN: One Animus shot, one Bad News shot. And
I also take, really quickly,

00:24:43.623 --> 00:24:44.939
I take a little damage.

00:24:44.939 --> 00:24:46.505
MATT: You take 2d6 psychic, right?

00:24:46.505 --> 00:24:55.559
TALIESIN: 2d6 psychic damage. Five, six, seven.
Seven points of psychic damage. Did I-- No. It

00:24:55.559 --> 00:25:00.483
doesn't matter anyway, because I was going to call
Hex, but I'll do it later. Fuck it. All right.

00:25:00.483 --> 00:25:04.657
Let's roll. I'm also going to run some Cabal's
Ruin into this, just for fun.

00:25:04.657 --> 00:25:05.688
MATT: Okay.

00:25:05.688 --> 00:25:07.695
TALIESIN: So, let's do the first one, is 1d10.

00:25:07.695 --> 00:25:12.451
MATT: So, do Cabal's Ruin damage at the end
because that is not halved.

00:25:12.451 --> 00:25:23.293
TALIESIN: Yeah. So, 1d10 plus 1d6. So, first shot
is ten points of piercing damage and four points

00:25:23.293 --> 00:25:24.751
of psychic damage.

00:25:24.751 --> 00:25:29.088
MATT: Ten points of piercing damage, so that's
reduced to five. And then how many points of

00:25:29.088 --> 00:25:31.632
psychic? Four points of psychic. Seven points of
damage.

00:25:31.684 --> 00:25:35.086
TALIESIN: Then, the Bad News is--

00:25:35.086 --> 00:25:41.871
MATT: Wait. Ten points-- it's nine. It was ten
points piercing reduced to five and then four

00:25:41.871 --> 00:25:43.043
psychic. So that's nine.

00:25:43.043 --> 00:25:44.993
TRAVIS: Oh, and the psychic's not reduced,
that's right.

00:25:44.993 --> 00:25:55.870
TALIESIN: So, that's cocked. That's seven, eight,
nine, ten, 11. 17 points of piercing damage.

00:25:55.918 --> 00:25:59.879
MATT: Okay, so take that down to eight.

00:25:59.879 --> 00:26:09.735
TALIESIN: And let's just-- three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine. This is not halved, is it?

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:10.921
MATT: Nope!

00:26:10.921 --> 00:26:12.493
TRAVIS: The psychic?

00:26:12.493 --> 00:26:15.891
MATT: No, this is Cabal's Ruin. He's pumping you
full of lightning damage.

00:26:15.891 --> 00:26:21.389
TALIESIN: I'm going to empty Cabal's Ruin into
him.

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:25.572
MATT: Okay! That's how many d6s?

00:26:25.572 --> 00:26:26.536
TALIESIN: 10d6.

00:26:26.536 --> 00:26:29.630
MATT: 10d6 lightning damage to you, Grog!

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:30.976
TRAVIS: Ones!

00:26:30.976 --> 00:26:32.400
SAM: Lot of ones.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.280
(laughing)

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.817
TALIESIN: Six, 15, 20.

00:26:39.817 --> 00:26:41.885
SAM: It's all threes and fours.

00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:43.133
LAURA: I'm so nervous.

00:26:43.133 --> 00:26:44.452
MARISHA: Me too.

00:26:44.452 --> 00:26:46.531
TALIESIN: 33 points of lightning damage.

00:26:46.531 --> 00:26:47.623
TRAVIS: 33.

00:26:47.623 --> 00:26:54.354
MATT: There you go. All right, Percival, and you
have movement. And a bonus, if you want.

00:26:54.354 --> 00:26:59.302
TALIESIN: I'm not going to blow my bonus for now,
but I am going to run down and across towards that

00:26:59.508 --> 00:27:01.508
tower towards you.

00:27:01.508 --> 00:27:07.535
MATT: Over here? That's 30 right there, right?

00:27:07.535 --> 00:27:11.510
SAM: There's like six cameras in front of us.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.803
TALIESIN: As far that way as I can go.

00:27:13.803 --> 00:27:16.450
MATT: Fair enough. All right, so, end of
Percival's turn.

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:21.863
LAURA: Oh! Oh! Are there lair actions?

00:27:21.863 --> 00:27:25.752
MATT: There are lair actions on this battlefield.

00:27:25.752 --> 00:27:27.578
TALIESIN: Is there a door, by the way, in that
thing?

00:27:27.578 --> 00:27:28.805
MATT: There's a door right there.

00:27:28.805 --> 00:27:30.161
TALIESIN: Okay, I'll eventually be heading towards
that.

00:27:30.161 --> 00:27:36.613
MATT: Okay. Well, as you're running by it,
Percival, you hear that low hum (humming) begins

00:27:36.613 --> 00:27:42.356
to (humming intensifies). Spin up, you hear this
crackling noise. And you watch as each of these

00:27:42.356 --> 00:27:47.627
four towers suddenly gives off this intense
vibration around it. As you're walking, you feel

00:27:47.627 --> 00:27:53.472
this force pulling on you, like being within a
certain radius of this is forcing you to move

00:27:53.472 --> 00:27:58.527
slower (grunting). That's all. Vex, your turn.

00:27:58.527 --> 00:28:04.651
LAURA: Okay, I can see Grog as well, because I'm
assuming his head is above those parapets?

00:28:04.651 --> 00:28:06.627
MATT: Yes. He does have half-cover from you
currently.

00:28:06.627 --> 00:28:08.594
LAURA: I have Sharpshooter, so he does not.

00:28:08.594 --> 00:28:09.464
MATT: All right!

00:28:09.464 --> 00:28:11.595
LAURA: I'm going to send Trinket down.

00:28:11.595 --> 00:28:15.797
MATT: So, Trinket does manage to get all the way
to the bottom and emerges from the front door

00:28:15.797 --> 00:28:18.046
there, but that's as far as Trinket can get with
his movement.

00:28:18.046 --> 00:28:19.615
LAURA: Trinket's like (confused bear sound).

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:22.255
TRAVIS: Aren't you concerned with the love of your
life running across the courtyard?

00:28:22.255 --> 00:28:26.664
LAURA: I can't see him! He's hidden, like from my
field of view, I'm assuming I can't really see

00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:28.675
him. Can I see Percy?

00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:31.875
MATT: Percy? Yeah, you can see Percy from there.

00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:40.576
LAURA: I'm going to still shoot Grog. Yeah, I'm
going to shoot Grog twice. Once with the Blazing

00:28:40.576 --> 00:28:48.312
Bowstring, and we're just going to see how that
goes. Aww man! 17.

00:28:48.312 --> 00:28:50.432
TRAVIS: That is my AC.

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:54.244
LAURA: So it hits! Yes! Oh, shit.

00:28:54.244 --> 00:28:55.958
TRAVIS: It's not too hard to hit me!

00:28:55.958 --> 00:28:58.638
MATT: You've just got a billion hit points.

00:28:58.638 --> 00:29:04.127
LAURA: 15. 15 plus four lightning damage.

00:29:04.127 --> 00:29:05.679
TRAVIS: Okay, halved.

00:29:05.679 --> 00:29:08.171
LAURA: Wait, lightning damage is halved?

00:29:08.171 --> 00:29:10.153
TRAVIS: Mm-hm, I have resistance to lightning
damage.

00:29:10.153 --> 00:29:11.885
MATT: You do when you go into your large form.

00:29:11.885 --> 00:29:16.538
TRAVIS: Oh, which I'm not, yet! So 15 halved is
eight, right?

00:29:16.584 --> 00:29:18.714
LAURA: Okay, and then four lightning damage.

00:29:18.714 --> 00:29:21.342
MATT: Which is why you didn't halve any of the
Cabal Ruin damage last round.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:25.449
LAURA: And then five points of fire damage.

00:29:25.449 --> 00:29:26.826
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:26.826 --> 00:29:29.174
LAURA: Damn it, he gets half piercing damage?

00:29:29.174 --> 00:29:30.226
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:31.971
LAURA: Fuck! Okay, I'm going to try it again.

00:29:31.971 --> 00:29:33.171
MATT: All right.

00:29:33.171 --> 00:29:35.870
LAURA: And that's an 18!

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:37.348
MATT: That hits!

00:29:37.348 --> 00:29:46.938
LAURA: 14 halved is seven. No, wait. Eight,
because it's 16 points of damage.

00:29:46.938 --> 00:29:48.488
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:48.488 --> 00:29:50.668
LAURA: Plus four lightning damage.

00:29:50.668 --> 00:29:52.096
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:52.096 --> 00:29:55.783
LAURA: Plus Blazing Bowstring. Seven points of
fire damage.

00:29:55.783 --> 00:29:56.591
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:29:56.591 --> 00:30:01.136
LAURA: And I'm going to use my bonus action. I'm
going to move down a couple parapets towards you

00:30:01.136 --> 00:30:03.959
and I'm going to keep hiding as my bonus action.

00:30:03.959 --> 00:30:06.316
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll a stealth check.

00:30:06.316 --> 00:30:10.840
LAURA: Do I have to roll if I've got skirmisher
stealth? Or do I just continue to hide? I'm just

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.362
wondering how that works.

00:30:13.362 --> 00:30:16.088
MATT: It's been a while since you used skirmisher
stealth.

00:30:16.088 --> 00:30:19.376
LAURA: I know. I don't remember. Yeah, it's a
ranger thing.

00:30:19.376 --> 00:30:25.611
TRAVIS: This fight started and I'm like (machine
gun fire). The fucking Godfather just

00:30:25.611 --> 00:30:27.418
(screaming).

00:30:27.418 --> 00:30:29.318
MATT: Basically. You're not wrong.

00:30:29.318 --> 00:30:31.824
TALIESIN: I hit you with a ball of lightning, man,
like a Tesla coil.

00:30:31.824 --> 00:30:36.753
TRAVIS: I climb up to the top of the tower like,
what's going on? (machine gun fire)

00:30:36.753 --> 00:30:41.438
MATT: At the start of your turn, you pick a
creature to remain hidden from,

00:30:41.438 --> 00:30:42.860
not a general hiding.

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:48.205
LAURA: Oh, so I could say, I'm keeping hidden from
Percy.

00:30:48.205 --> 00:30:50.442
MATT: Yep. But everybody else can still see you.

00:30:50.442 --> 00:30:52.625
LAURA: And then I would roll for stealth to hide
from everybody else?

00:30:52.625 --> 00:30:54.175
MATT: If you wanted to make the hide action.

00:30:54.175 --> 00:31:03.022
LAURA: I'm going to keep hidden from Percy for
skirmisher stealth, and then I'm going to roll for

00:31:03.022 --> 00:31:08.171
stealth, and I got a 24 to hide from everybody
else.

00:31:08.224 --> 00:31:16.299
MATT: Okay. Good to know. Now, you guys are aware
she's there, you just cannot shoot her or attack

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:20.090
her from this distance necessarily. All right,
that ends your turn?

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.171
LAURA: Yeah.

00:31:21.171 --> 00:31:24.703
MATT: Grog. Mr. Pincushion. What are you doing?

00:31:24.703 --> 00:31:37.884
TRAVIS: I take the Titanstone Knuckles and I smash
them together and I cast Enlarge on myself. Is

00:31:37.884 --> 00:31:39.474
Doty up there with you?

00:31:39.474 --> 00:31:42.723
SAM: Oh, sure. He's holding me in a ball.

00:31:42.723 --> 00:31:44.537
MATT: Like a giant hamster ball.

00:31:44.537 --> 00:31:49.943
(laughter)

00:31:49.943 --> 00:31:53.359
TALIESIN: Do it.

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:55.973
LAURA: Is this tee-time?

00:31:55.973 --> 00:31:59.012
TRAVIS: Can I go into a frenzied rage?

00:31:59.012 --> 00:32:00.227
MATT: Yeah.

00:32:00.227 --> 00:32:05.899
TRAVIS: And can I try and shove Doty off of the
top of the tower?

00:32:05.899 --> 00:32:07.737
MATT: Yes, you may.

00:32:07.737 --> 00:32:11.775
SAM: You'll have to succeed a wisdom saving throw,
first.

00:32:11.775 --> 00:32:12.909
MATT: Yes, you do.

00:32:12.909 --> 00:32:15.869
TRAVIS: My wisdom ain't bad. My intelligence is
dick-all.

00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:17.293
MATT: Make a wisdom saving throw.

00:32:17.293 --> 00:32:21.922
TRAVIS: Okay. 14.

00:32:21.922 --> 00:32:28.077
MATT: Nope. So you go to shove him, and you go
(groan).

00:32:28.077 --> 00:32:30.435
TRAVIS: Oh, because he's got Sanctuary on
himself!

00:32:30.435 --> 00:32:32.365
LAURA: That's what Earthbreaker Groon had!

00:32:32.365 --> 00:32:34.080
MATT: Yep. That's what Earthbreaker Groon did to
you.

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.386
TRAVIS: Understood.

00:32:35.386 --> 00:32:39.127
SAM: You can still make the attack, you just have
to point it at someone else.

00:32:39.127 --> 00:32:43.552
TRAVIS: Interesting. I choose to urinate all
over-- no.

00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:47.918
TALIESIN: Does the ball count as someone else, or
just Doty?

00:32:47.918 --> 00:32:50.171
MATT: You can attack the ball, but it does
nothing.

00:32:50.171 --> 00:32:51.990
SAM: Well, it'll throw me away.

00:32:51.990 --> 00:33:01.724
TRAVIS: Interesting, interesting. I don't learn
lessons very well. I'm going to try again. One

00:33:01.724 --> 00:33:03.618
more time. I get three attacks, so.

00:33:03.618 --> 00:33:05.150
MATT: Okay. So you're going to do the second shove
attack.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.533
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:33:06.533 --> 00:33:08.188
MATT: Wisdom save.

00:33:08.188 --> 00:33:09.421
TRAVIS: 17?

00:33:09.421 --> 00:33:11.171
SAM: I mean, that's it. DC 17.

00:33:11.171 --> 00:33:20.510
MATT: Okay, so now getting Doty's sheet out here.
For a shove attack, I believe it's a contested

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.412
athletics check, let me double-check real fast.

00:33:23.412 --> 00:33:25.192
TRAVIS: Okay. Not strength, but athletics?

00:33:25.255 --> 00:33:31.962
MATT: Pretty sure. I'm sure the Internet right now
is going, "No, it's this! God damn it, Mercer!"

00:33:31.962 --> 00:33:39.002
No, it's athletics contested by athletics, so go
ahead and roll an athletics check, Grog. With

00:33:39.002 --> 00:33:41.849
advantage, because you're raging.

00:33:41.849 --> 00:33:44.058
TRAVIS: That's higher.

00:33:44.058 --> 00:33:49.571
MATT: Roll a d20, add four. For Doty.

00:33:49.571 --> 00:33:51.442
SAM: 14.

00:33:51.442 --> 00:33:52.812
TRAVIS: 24.

00:33:52.812 --> 00:33:58.014
SAM: (Goofy-style screaming)

00:33:58.014 --> 00:34:05.772
MATT: You watch as Doty turns to Grog, goes,
"Tary?" (bang) and end over end gets shoved off

00:34:05.815 --> 00:34:15.464
the parapet, slamming onto the ground, prone here
at the bottom of the chain. You, Taryon, fly off

00:34:15.464 --> 00:34:22.669
(boing) harmlessly and roll into the middle of the
pool, and are currently now on your side.

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:28.117
SAM: Floating? Is it like at Ren Faire? I'm in one
of those balls!

00:34:28.117 --> 00:34:40.243
MATT: For the 30-foot fall, Doty takes 11 points
of bludgeoning damage.

00:34:40.243 --> 00:34:41.900
SAM: Still alive, he's fine.

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.931
MATT: And is prone. (chuckles)

00:34:43.931 --> 00:34:47.341
TRAVIS: I have some movement left.

00:34:47.341 --> 00:34:50.612
MATT: You do. You have 40 feet of movement left.

00:34:50.612 --> 00:34:53.847
TRAVIS: Right. Is there a trap door at the top of
the tower?

00:34:53.847 --> 00:34:54.865
MATT: There is, yes.

00:34:54.865 --> 00:34:58.114
TRAVIS: Would I need an action or a bonus to be
able to open it? To go down into it?

00:34:58.114 --> 00:35:01.080
MATT: It would be an action to lift it up.

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:06.884
TRAVIS: I have one-- well, I have an attack. Okay.
Can I move to the--

00:35:06.884 --> 00:35:09.815
MATT: Actually, it's not that much, because it's
not locked or anything. You can probably just pull

00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:10.774
it open.

00:35:10.774 --> 00:35:13.068
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'd like to go into the tower
stairs.

00:35:13.068 --> 00:35:18.322
MATT: Okay. So, with the rest of your movement, 40
feet, you can get almost to the bottom, so you're

00:35:18.322 --> 00:35:20.525
partway through that.

00:35:20.525 --> 00:35:21.864
TRAVIS: And I'm still inside, right?

00:35:21.864 --> 00:35:22.932
MATT: Yeah, you're still inside.

00:35:22.932 --> 00:35:24.933
TRAVIS: Great. As long as no one can... yeah.

00:35:24.933 --> 00:35:30.138
MATT: All right. That ends your turn, Grog.
Keyleth. Your turn.

00:35:30.138 --> 00:35:33.220
TRAVIS: Fucking hamster ball piece of shit.

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.530
MATT: That's so awesome!

00:35:34.530 --> 00:35:36.940
SAM: I might be alive for a long time after you're
all dead.

00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:42.742
MARISHA: That's kind of true. Ten rounds, that's a
long fucking time. Okay, question. The radius of

00:35:42.742 --> 00:35:47.657
the (energy field sound effect). I have Freedom of
Movement, do I seem to not be affected by that?

00:35:47.657 --> 00:35:54.983
MATT: You seem to not be affected by it, actually.
You see it there, and as you push forward a little

00:35:54.983 --> 00:35:59.313
bit with your hand, it doesn't seem to be-- the
gravitational shift isn't affecting you.

00:35:59.313 --> 00:36:07.030
MARISHA: Cool. I'm going to move up and forward
this direction.

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.639
MATT: Up this way?

00:36:08.639 --> 00:36:11.295
MARISHA: Yeah, one, two, three, stop right there!

00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:12.523
MATT: Right there on the edge?

00:36:12.523 --> 00:36:14.041
MARISHA: Do I see Doty?

00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:19.982
MATT: You can just barely see the edge of Doty
right past these. You see his head on the ground.

00:36:19.982 --> 00:36:23.386
You see Taryon in the middle, and you see Percival
right there.

00:36:23.386 --> 00:36:26.337
LAURA: I like the idea of seeing Tary like...

00:36:26.337 --> 00:36:28.302
MARISHA: I can move one more square, correct?

00:36:28.302 --> 00:36:32.867
MATT: You can move three more squares if you want
to.

00:36:32.867 --> 00:36:37.517
SAM: The inside of the ball is all puke smeared
everywhere.

00:36:37.517 --> 00:36:41.559
MARISHA: Okay. Move me up to the doorway, up one
more.

00:36:41.559 --> 00:36:46.703
MATT: Okay. You can look inside now. You see a
small chamber, and what appears to be a small

00:36:46.703 --> 00:36:50.575
chest against the wall there, and this area is
just an open space.

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:52.563
LAURA: Oh, fuck, is there loot?

00:36:52.563 --> 00:36:54.185
TRAVIS: You shut your damn mouth.

00:36:54.185 --> 00:36:56.328
LAURA: And I'm up top?! Fuck.

00:36:56.328 --> 00:36:57.729
MARISHA: That's good to know.

00:36:57.729 --> 00:37:01.076
TALIESIN: You have a beacon. It's a very nice
beacon.

00:37:01.076 --> 00:37:04.568
LAURA: I do have a beacon. I have a feeling that
beacon is going to attack us.

00:37:04.568 --> 00:37:05.940
TALIESIN: It's probably going to attack us.

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.980
TRAVIS: No! It's so benignly designed.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:17.196
MARISHA: I'm going to, on top of Doty, cast a
5th-level Flaming Sphere.

00:37:17.196 --> 00:37:26.988
MATT: (laughing) Okay! (boom) So, you watch as,
suddenly, spiraling out of the air, this swirl of

00:37:26.988 --> 00:37:35.509
fire forms into a large, burning ball of flame
that begins to collide and burn and singe into

00:37:35.509 --> 00:37:41.827
Doty's (squealing metal) prone form on the ground,
still reeling from the impact of being knocked off

00:37:41.827 --> 00:37:49.664
the tower. That's 5d6 damage. Go ahead and roll a
dexterity saving throw for Doty. I think it's

00:37:49.664 --> 00:37:50.867
dexterity, right?

00:37:50.867 --> 00:37:52.154
MARISHA: He's prone.

00:37:52.154 --> 00:37:58.158
MATT: Prone doesn't change your dexterity saving
throw.

00:37:58.158 --> 00:38:04.523
SAM: Oh, I rolled a 16, plus dexterity of zero. So
16.

00:38:04.523 --> 00:38:09.365
MATT: That does not make her DC, unfortunately. So
that's 5d6 points of fire damage against Doty.

00:38:09.365 --> 00:38:18.254
MARISHA: 18, 20, 21, 22! 22, and then--

00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:19.826
MATT: 22 points of fire damage.

00:38:19.826 --> 00:38:21.103
SAM: Sure, sure.

00:38:21.103 --> 00:38:31.297
MARISHA: I don't get any other bonuses, okay. I'm
going to say, sorry, Tary! And then go (whoosh)

00:38:31.297 --> 00:38:36.213
and go fire elemental form, and hope that this
isn't a mistake.

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:39.564
TRAVIS: Please be nothing but black powder in the
chest.

00:38:39.564 --> 00:38:41.897
MARISHA: Wouldn't hurt me none.

00:38:41.897 --> 00:38:52.412
MATT: Just, "Tary?" (explosion) Just a white flash
like Akira opening.

00:38:52.412 --> 00:38:56.161
MARISHA: Can I do any more movement with my
elemental form?

00:38:56.161 --> 00:39:01.740
MATT: You know what? You had ten feet of movement
left.

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.993
MARISHA: I'm going to pop into the room.

00:39:03.993 --> 00:39:11.295
MATT: So I'll say, boom, boom. There you go. So
you flicker inside and you are currently contained

00:39:11.295 --> 00:39:12.781
on the inside there.

00:39:12.781 --> 00:39:15.053
LAURA: Ooh, with the roof on there and
everything.

00:39:15.053 --> 00:39:20.531
MATT: Oh, yeah. It's all sorts of held up there
for you. So, that ends your turn, Keyleth. Taryon.

00:39:20.531 --> 00:39:26.603
You are floating in a sphere over a pool of murky
green liquid.

00:39:26.603 --> 00:39:37.655
SAM: End of round one. Okay. Action: Prep my
healing draught. Just pour it into a bottle and

00:39:37.655 --> 00:39:42.373
get it ready to rock. Bonus: Click my Boots of
Speed.

00:39:42.373 --> 00:39:44.673
MATT: Boots of Speed, clicked.

00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:48.181
SAM: Movement: (rapid vibration sound effect)

00:39:48.181 --> 00:39:52.852
TRAVIS: Like Sonic the Hedgehog?

00:39:52.852 --> 00:39:57.694
SAM: With my Boots of Speed on, and the feat that
I took, I've got 80 feet of movement.

00:39:57.694 --> 00:40:02.488
TRAVIS: Have you ever run in one of those balls on
the water? They don't go anywhere, man.

00:40:02.488 --> 00:40:06.178
SAM: Shh. It's shooting water everywhere, it's
spraying it on Keyleth!

00:40:06.178 --> 00:40:16.355
MATT: You have 80 feet of movement on the sphere.
However, the sphere is half your movement to push

00:40:16.355 --> 00:40:18.333
it, so you get to push it 40 feet.

00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:21.908
SAM: But I'm also in water, and I don't know if it
has any friction or anything.

00:40:21.908 --> 00:40:28.531
MATT: Right now, on the water, you get about that
far.

00:40:28.531 --> 00:40:30.140
SAM: Hey, I moved!

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:39.722
MATT: (straining sound) It's splashing behind, the
ball's coasting, and you're almost three, two feet

00:40:39.722 --> 00:40:44.047
from the edge of the rock, and you're like, "Oh
God! Oh God!" The sweat's starting to pour from

00:40:44.047 --> 00:40:45.034
your brow.

00:40:45.034 --> 00:40:47.086
TRAVIS: You're vomiting inside the sphere.

00:40:47.086 --> 00:40:53.083
TALIESIN: Like the worst spin art ever.

00:40:53.083 --> 00:40:57.571
MARISHA: Throwing up the wine you drank earlier.

00:40:57.571 --> 00:40:59.442
MATT: All right. And what's Doty going to do?

00:40:59.442 --> 00:41:07.280
SAM: I can't communicate with him, I don't think.
I don't think sound can escape, so he's going to

00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:10.964
keep doing what I told him to do. Get to me, and
keep me away from other people.

00:41:10.964 --> 00:41:18.108
MATT: Trapped inside the sphere, it doesn't say
anything about it making silence or blocking

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:20.385
sound, so you can still communicate.

00:41:20.385 --> 00:41:25.528
TRAVIS: Does Sanctuary stay on Doty now, or does
it go away when I hit him?

00:41:25.528 --> 00:41:27.987
MATT: Sanctuary, once you get an attack--

00:41:27.987 --> 00:41:29.186
SAM: It lasts a minute.

00:41:29.186 --> 00:41:30.715
MATT: It lasts a minute until--

00:41:30.715 --> 00:41:33.834
SAM: It doesn't say if he gets hit it ends.

00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:40.820
MATT: I'm pretty sure it's until the creature
attacks. Yes, until the warded creature takes an

00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:42.938
attack. So right now, it still has Sanctuary on.

00:41:43.004 --> 00:41:45.577
SAM: Okay, but if he attacks he'll lose it.

00:41:45.577 --> 00:41:46.700
MATT: Yes.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:56.054
SAM: I'm going to tell him to do that. Get to me
and get me away from other people. This is a

00:41:56.054 --> 00:41:59.318
suicide mission for Doty, guys, this is not going
to end well for him.

00:41:59.318 --> 00:42:01.338
TALIESIN: Doty's not going to win this.

00:42:01.338 --> 00:42:05.196
MATT: That's a valid point and reminder. It
probably will be fine, but Keyleth, I should've

00:42:05.196 --> 00:42:07.252
remembered, because he did have Sanctuary.

00:42:07.252 --> 00:42:10.863
SAM: No, it's okay, because hers was an area of
effect.

00:42:10.863 --> 00:42:15.763
MATT: No, it wasn't. You target it to ram into
something. It wasn't a Fireball.

00:42:15.763 --> 00:42:17.536
MARISHA: I have to make a wisdom saving throw?

00:42:17.536 --> 00:42:22.867
MATT: Wisdom saving throw. Because it says "target
with a harmful spell." So, yes.

00:42:22.867 --> 00:42:29.051
MARISHA: I've got crazy high wisdom. 22.

00:42:29.051 --> 00:42:33.456
MATT: You're fine. I just wanted to double check
on that, because I totally forgot about the

00:42:33.456 --> 00:42:41.397
Sanctuary. But still warded with Sanctuary,
getting up, half movement, so Doty has 20 more

00:42:41.397 --> 00:42:46.307
feet to move, I think. Speed of 40. What do you
want Doty to do?

00:42:46.307 --> 00:42:48.468
SAM: Get to me and push me away.

00:42:48.468 --> 00:42:50.941
MATT: Okay, so Doty's going to move five--

00:42:50.941 --> 00:42:52.953
MARISHA: Is he not affected by the gravity thing?

00:42:52.953 --> 00:43:06.575
MATT: No, he is, and he gets about that far.
Doty's like (clanging metal) "Tary!" A ball of

00:43:06.575 --> 00:43:13.128
flames just slamming into the back. All right. I
think that ends your turn, Taryon. Percival,

00:43:13.128 --> 00:43:14.273
you're up.

00:43:14.273 --> 00:43:17.547
TALIESIN: I'm going to dive into that room.

00:43:17.547 --> 00:43:26.449
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15, 20. Your movement's
halved, it's like rough terrain, essentially, as

00:43:26.449 --> 00:43:27.757
you're moving forward.

00:43:27.757 --> 00:43:29.793
TALIESIN: So I've got two more movement? Two more
bits of movement?

00:43:29.793 --> 00:43:32.959
MATT: Two more. But now as you get into the
doorway, it's not affecting you anymore. You do

00:43:32.959 --> 00:43:34.341
see a small chest in the corner.

00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:37.129
TALIESIN: I'm going to go over to the chest. I'm
going to try and fix my gun really quickly.

00:43:37.129 --> 00:43:39.207
MATT: Okay, so make an action to try and repair it
real fast.

00:43:39.207 --> 00:43:45.198
TALIESIN: That's fine. Had to roll a nine, I got a
12.

00:43:45.198 --> 00:43:46.653
MATT: Okay, yeah. So you repair Animus.

00:43:46.653 --> 00:43:49.808
TALIESIN: And then I can't open the chest as
well.

00:43:49.808 --> 00:43:51.193
MATT: It's an action to do that, yeah.

00:43:51.193 --> 00:43:53.603
TALIESIN: All right. I'm just going to hide and
wait.

00:43:53.603 --> 00:43:58.914
MATT: Okay. So there you are. You are inside of
that chamber. Perfect.

00:43:58.914 --> 00:44:03.600
SAM: Explosions.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:14.166
MATT: All right. The large pillars that were
humming diminish. The slowly shifting blue,

00:44:14.166 --> 00:44:22.588
crackling towers at the top of each large tower
begin to spin faster, and you hear (crackling) and

00:44:22.588 --> 00:44:27.731
bursts of electrical energy just (static) out of
each side. Everyone on the tower, which would just

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:30.377
be you, I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw.

00:44:30.377 --> 00:44:31.799
TALIESIN: Yeah!

00:44:31.799 --> 00:44:34.190
LAURA: Are you celebrating that I'm getting hurt?

00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:35.147
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:44:35.147 --> 00:44:36.539
LAURA: You dick.

00:44:36.539 --> 00:44:39.763
TALIESIN: I'm so excited that I don't have to be
the one to kill you. I don't want to be the one to

00:44:39.763 --> 00:44:41.564
kill you. I'll never live that down.

00:44:41.564 --> 00:44:42.493
LAURA: 24.

00:44:42.493 --> 00:44:45.768
MATT: Okay, so you succeed. It would be 16 points
of lightning damage, it's reduced to eight. So you

00:44:45.768 --> 00:44:47.616
take eight points of lightning damage.

00:44:47.616 --> 00:44:48.607
LAURA: All right.

00:44:48.607 --> 00:44:53.330
MATT: And then as the bolt subsides, the towers
slowly spin back down and appear to have gone

00:44:53.330 --> 00:44:54.789
dormant once more.

00:44:54.789 --> 00:44:56.569
TALIESIN: This is a great map.

00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:59.107
MATT: This has been fun so far. You guys just
barely got into it.

00:44:59.107 --> 00:45:02.216
TRAVIS: Call of Duty needs to copy this map.

00:45:02.216 --> 00:45:06.650
MATT: All right. Laura.

00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:07.705
LAURA: Yeah?

00:45:07.705 --> 00:45:08.675
MATT: Your turn.

00:45:08.675 --> 00:45:09.722
LAURA: Okay.

00:45:09.722 --> 00:45:10.794
MATT: What you got, Vex?

00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:12.322
LAURA: Okay. Who can I see?

00:45:12.322 --> 00:45:19.328
MATT: You can see Doty. You can see Taryon. You
watched Keyleth turn into the fire elemental and

00:45:19.328 --> 00:45:22.303
disappear into this chamber. And you watched Percy
run into this chamber.

00:45:22.303 --> 00:45:24.148
TRAVIS: And the roofs of the chambers are stone,
wood?

00:45:24.148 --> 00:45:25.830
MATT: They're stone. Five feet of stone.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.761
TALIESIN: We can't give suggestions, can we, over
the earpiece?

00:45:28.761 --> 00:45:34.134
MATT: You can if you want to. You guys are welcome
to communicate between each other for this.

00:45:34.134 --> 00:45:36.477
TRAVIS: On your turn!

00:45:36.477 --> 00:45:40.350
TALIESIN: Oh, shit. Damn it. Fuck, I had such a
good thing to do!

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:50.360
LAURA: Okay. Trinket's going to run up to Tary and
push him back in the water.

00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:53.555
(laughing)

00:45:53.555 --> 00:45:59.497
MATT: Trinket runs up (heavy footsteps) (growl)
and shoves you, and you spin back.

00:45:59.497 --> 00:46:01.509
LAURA: Just gentle enough to put him right in the
middle.

00:46:01.509 --> 00:46:07.078
MATT: Roll a strength check, because this is
pushing against Taryon's wound-up, Sonic the

00:46:07.078 --> 00:46:08.666
Hedgehog, gotta-go-fast speed.

00:46:08.666 --> 00:46:10.154
LAURA: 16.

00:46:10.214 --> 00:46:13.181
MATT: 16. Okay, make a strength check.

00:46:13.181 --> 00:46:16.191
SAM: Oh, no. Eight.

00:46:16.191 --> 00:46:19.959
MATT: Yeah, you get pushed back right into the
center of the water there.

00:46:19.959 --> 00:46:24.833
TALIESIN: This is the Overwatch map I've been
waiting for.

00:46:24.833 --> 00:46:32.201
LAURA: Well, then, I'll tell you what. Was that an
attack for Trinket?

00:46:32.201 --> 00:46:34.477
MATT: Yeah, that was Trinket's attack. It was a
shove attack.

00:46:34.477 --> 00:46:43.007
LAURA: Okay, then I'm going to save my action
until somebody outside of

00:46:43.007 --> 00:46:46.429
Tary or Doty becomes visible.

00:46:46.429 --> 00:46:49.954
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your attack action,
arrow ready, waiting for someone else to show up.

00:46:49.954 --> 00:46:52.704
That ends your turn, Vex. Grog, you're up.

00:46:52.704 --> 00:47:02.780
TRAVIS: I'll remedy that shit. Can I rage-tiptoe
up to the doorway at the bottom?

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:05.342
MATT: Okay, you (ferocious growling) (quieter
growling).

00:47:05.342 --> 00:47:07.332
LAURA: The minute I see his head!

00:47:07.332 --> 00:47:11.411
MATT: You glance through and you see a large,
burning ball of fire that's right there, just

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:18.634
chilling. You see Doty (heavy footsteps) running
away towards the water, where you see Taryon being

00:47:18.634 --> 00:47:21.688
pushed back in the water by a large bear.

00:47:21.688 --> 00:47:24.331
TRAVIS: And the fireball's around here?

00:47:24.331 --> 00:47:30.068
MATT: And as soon as you glance up... a dual arrow
release.

00:47:30.068 --> 00:47:31.210
LAURA: 17.

00:47:31.210 --> 00:47:32.380
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:35.121
MATT: Yep. So you get two strikes on this.

00:47:35.121 --> 00:47:39.023
TRAVIS: I mean, I'm literally doing this, so does
she get me in the fucking eyeball?

00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:40.077
MATT: Yep.

00:47:40.077 --> 00:47:41.280
TRAVIS: Oh, God.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.812
LAURA: 11 halved. Plus three lightning damage.

00:47:44.812 --> 00:47:49.063
MATT: So eight damage. Or, because lightning's
halved, too, right?

00:47:49.063 --> 00:47:50.743
LAURA: Oh, because you're enlarged.

00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:51.861
MATT: So six damage.

00:47:51.861 --> 00:47:53.022
LAURA: All right.

00:47:53.022 --> 00:47:54.517
TALIESIN: Whittle him down.

00:47:54.517 --> 00:48:05.176
LAURA: Ooh, that next one is good. That definitely
hits. And then 16, 17, 19 halved.

00:48:05.176 --> 00:48:07.311
TRAVIS: Nine?

00:48:07.311 --> 00:48:08.987
LAURA: Because he's not by anybody, is he?

00:48:08.987 --> 00:48:10.350
MATT: Currently, no.

00:48:10.350 --> 00:48:11.424
LAURA: Okay.

00:48:11.424 --> 00:48:17.161
MATT: By the way, it is a tiny doorway, and you
are a big man. The hatch you went through was a

00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:23.985
leap down, and you barely fit through. This
doorway is going to cost you some movement to get

00:48:23.985 --> 00:48:24.916
through it.

00:48:24.916 --> 00:48:28.669
TRAVIS: Oh, balls and ass. Okay, can I, after
getting shot in the face--

00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:32.003
MATT: Yeah, it's like (whooshing arrow) (scream).

00:48:32.003 --> 00:48:35.371
TALIESIN: You're not having a good day. You're
like an Ernest film right now.

00:48:35.371 --> 00:48:37.508
Ernest goes to war.

00:48:37.508 --> 00:48:41.755
TRAVIS: Ernest goes to camp. Can I break out
through the door and run down here to this corner

00:48:41.755 --> 00:48:43.942
as far as I can? How far do you think I can get
with my movement?

00:48:43.942 --> 00:48:47.445
MATT: You get out there, it'll take you ten
movement. To get to the doorway, it took you ten

00:48:47.445 --> 00:48:50.314
movement, to move and get out of it, so you have
30 more feet from here.

00:48:50.314 --> 00:48:52.870
TRAVIS: Okay. How far will that take me on those
squares?

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:53.910
MATT: Going this way?

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:55.257
TRAVIS: To that corner.

00:48:55.257 --> 00:48:59.042
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20, 25, 30. You can get
there.

00:48:59.042 --> 00:49:01.628
TRAVIS: Yeah, actually, can I come towards you
instead of going back that way,

00:49:01.628 --> 00:49:04.393
and can I lay down prone?

00:49:04.393 --> 00:49:07.619
MATT: Sure.

00:49:07.619 --> 00:49:13.792
LAURA: Down and dirty.

00:49:13.792 --> 00:49:18.220
MATT: All righty. Grog is lying down prone. Is
that your turn?

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:24.662
TRAVIS: Can I use my Second Wind to roll a 1d10?

00:49:24.662 --> 00:49:25.937
MATT: Yes, you can.

00:49:25.937 --> 00:49:30.434
TRAVIS: Okay. Plus my fighter level. Fucking A.
Ten plus two. 12.

00:49:30.434 --> 00:49:35.509
MATT: There you go. You gain 12 hit points. All
right. So, Grog, that's your turn?

00:49:35.509 --> 00:49:36.633
TRAVIS: That's my turn.

00:49:36.633 --> 00:49:41.871
MATT: Keyleth. You didn't use your action, so if
you wanted to, you could use your action to move

00:49:41.871 --> 00:49:44.569
again if you wanted to dash. Don't forget you have
that option.

00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:47.049
TRAVIS: Oh! Is that 50 more feet? Oh, really?

00:49:47.049 --> 00:49:51.236
MATT: Yeah. If you're not using your action for
anything else, and your Second Wind is a bonus

00:49:51.236 --> 00:49:52.585
action, if I recall, correct?

00:49:52.585 --> 00:49:53.414
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:53.414 --> 00:49:54.332
MATT: So yeah.

00:49:54.332 --> 00:50:01.014
TRAVIS: Yeah, let's just mad-dash tear ass towards
the tower that shot me in the eyeball. I might not

00:50:01.014 --> 00:50:02.494
even get all the way, but we're going to see.

00:50:02.494 --> 00:50:05.372
MATT: All right, so instead of falling prone, you
go.

00:50:05.372 --> 00:50:10.766
TRAVIS: Yeah, just turn the corner and book it
like the T-1000 in Terminator 2, just chopping.

00:50:10.766 --> 00:50:15.559
MATT: Do you want to go this way or this way to
get towards the tower?

00:50:15.559 --> 00:50:17.822
Like, the perimeter or center?

00:50:17.822 --> 00:50:18.967
TRAVIS: Perimeter. Perimeter.

00:50:18.967 --> 00:50:22.065
MATT: Okay. You get there, and then you go prone?

00:50:22.065 --> 00:50:23.142
TRAVIS: Yeah!

00:50:23.142 --> 00:50:24.917
MATT: All righty. Say you're prone there.

00:50:24.917 --> 00:50:26.911
LAURA: Can totally see your head outside of the--

00:50:26.911 --> 00:50:27.862
TRAVIS: No you can't.

00:50:27.862 --> 00:50:29.912
LAURA: Yeah, I can. From where I am, I can see
your head.

00:50:29.912 --> 00:50:35.252
MATT: From where you are, you cannot see him. You
watched him run; he wasn't being stealthy about it

00:50:35.252 --> 00:50:37.175
and he's 12 feet tall right now.

00:50:37.175 --> 00:50:38.775
TRAVIS: Team Target Practice!

00:50:38.775 --> 00:50:43.428
MATT: You're watching him (heavy footsteps) and
he's just out of view, but you know exactly where

00:50:43.428 --> 00:50:52.077
he is. Ends Grog's turn. Keyleth, you're up. You
see a giant Grog just (heavy footsteps) loom past

00:50:52.077 --> 00:50:57.319
the outside of the structure. You see this
flickering fire of Keyleth's elemental form in the

00:50:57.319 --> 00:50:59.162
inside of this structure there.

00:50:59.162 --> 00:51:08.667
MARISHA: I look to see if he's going to keep
going. Okay, know where Grog is. Is there any

00:51:08.667 --> 00:51:11.923
windows in this little shack that we're in or--

00:51:11.923 --> 00:51:14.961
MATT: No, there's just the doorway here and the
doorway here. Those are the only--

00:51:14.961 --> 00:51:17.314
MARISHA: No bars or cracks or crevices?

00:51:17.314 --> 00:51:21.771
MATT: Not from what you can tell. You can
investigate for it if you want to, but that'll be

00:51:21.771 --> 00:51:22.769
your action.

00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:28.355
MARISHA: No, fuck that. Okay, I'm going to move
out-- sorry.

00:51:28.402 --> 00:51:34.112
I'm going to go up to Trinket over here.

00:51:34.112 --> 00:51:37.687
LAURA: Aww. You terrible person.

00:51:37.687 --> 00:51:39.496
MARISHA: Can I get into Trinket's space?

00:51:39.496 --> 00:51:41.956
MATT: Yeah, it's 25 feet to get into Trinket's
space.

00:51:41.956 --> 00:51:45.152
MARISHA: Well, let me do my attack first.

00:51:45.152 --> 00:51:49.690
MATT: Okay, go for it. So 20 movement right next
to Trinket.

00:51:49.690 --> 00:51:55.385
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, good job with the
ball, buddy! Shh, go to sleep! Go to sleep, we'll

00:51:55.385 --> 00:52:00.113
make it less painful for you! We'll make this very
painless. Go to sleep. I'm sorry, I just can't

00:52:00.113 --> 00:52:05.105
have you messing stuff up right now! That's true.
I'm trying to smoke him out first.

00:52:05.105 --> 00:52:09.125
TALIESIN: Your nervous system knows to keep you
awake and conscious for that whole event.

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:14.064
SAM: Only you can prevent--

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:16.022
MARISHA: 15 for the first one.

00:52:16.022 --> 00:52:17.384
MATT: I believe that misses on Trinket.

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:18.823
MARISHA: Natural 20 for the second.

00:52:18.823 --> 00:52:22.351
MATT: Okay! So, the first one misses, the second
one definitely hits. Go ahead and roll double-die

00:52:22.351 --> 00:52:24.206
damage on the second one.

00:52:24.244 --> 00:52:28.450
TALIESIN: It's un-bear-able.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:38.016
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. I also get an extra
d6 for my fire hands.

00:52:38.016 --> 00:52:42.935
And then I double die roll, right?

00:52:42.935 --> 00:52:44.650
MATT: Yes, and then add the bonus.

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:51.778
MARISHA: 14, 15, so 30, plus 33 fire damage.

00:52:51.778 --> 00:52:55.164
MATT: So Trinket takes 33 fire damage and is
currently on fire.

00:52:55.164 --> 00:52:56.657
LAURA: Aww, buddy.

00:52:56.657 --> 00:53:00.982
MATT: So, Trinket is like (very unhappy bear
groans) (roars).

00:53:00.982 --> 00:53:02.501
SAM: There's water right there!

00:53:02.501 --> 00:53:09.451
MARISHA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action
to turn over and take my flaming sphere and go

00:53:09.451 --> 00:53:11.984
(whoosh) and ram Tary again.

00:53:12.045 --> 00:53:13.405
MATT: Tary or Doty?

00:53:13.405 --> 00:53:14.928
MARISHA: Doty, sorry.

00:53:14.928 --> 00:53:17.985
MATT: Go ahead and make another wisdom saving
throw.

00:53:17.985 --> 00:53:20.312
LAURA: Wait, how many damage was that?

00:53:20.312 --> 00:53:22.572
TALIESIN: 35?

00:53:22.572 --> 00:53:24.788
LAURA: 34? I'm going to say 34.

00:53:24.788 --> 00:53:26.881
MARISHA: 19.

00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:30.543
MATT: 19? Yeah. Go ahead and roll a dexterity
saving throw for Doty,

00:53:30.543 --> 00:53:32.641
and roll another 5d6 fire damage.

00:53:32.641 --> 00:53:36.359
SAM: Pretty good, this is plus his dex, which is
nothing. 18.

00:53:36.359 --> 00:53:38.543
MATT: What's your spell DC?

00:53:38.543 --> 00:53:40.233
MARISHA: 20.

00:53:40.233 --> 00:53:43.381
MATT: Yeah, no. So, full 5d6 fire damage.

00:53:43.381 --> 00:53:53.501
MARISHA: Those don't count, it's fine. That's not
great. I can reroll that one. Two, four, six,

00:53:53.501 --> 00:53:57.827
eight, 11 points of fire damage.

00:53:57.827 --> 00:53:59.557
SAM: We have our first victim.

00:53:59.557 --> 00:54:01.238
LAURA: Oh, Doty!

00:54:01.238 --> 00:54:06.227
MATT: As the ball slams into the back, you watch
as Doty's open chamber where the book is held goes

00:54:06.227 --> 00:54:09.747
(cling) and flings open as fire bursts out from
the inside.

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:10.973
TRAVIS: Protect the book!

00:54:10.973 --> 00:54:11.806
SAM: No!

00:54:11.806 --> 00:54:16.361
MATT: He's now burnt and hollowed out from the
inside, and you watch as a cinder cluster of pages

00:54:16.361 --> 00:54:24.446
hits the ground before burning away. Doty goes,
"Tar--" (clang) and falls to the ground.

00:54:24.446 --> 00:54:25.866
MARISHA: Sorry! Sorry, guys!

00:54:25.866 --> 00:54:28.793
SAM: Does the fire ignite his cannon hand?

00:54:28.793 --> 00:54:31.963
TRAVIS: Look, he's rolling for it!

00:54:31.963 --> 00:54:40.723
MATT: One arm detonates. It doesn't hit anybody,
but there's now curled pieces of broken and

00:54:40.723 --> 00:54:43.697
sheared metal where the arm once was.

00:54:43.697 --> 00:54:49.375
MARISHA: I'm going to take my other 25 feet of
movement that I have left to go back into the--

00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:50.913
MATT: What's the speed of your fire elemental?

00:54:50.913 --> 00:54:51.669
MARISHA: 50.

00:54:51.669 --> 00:54:57.450
MATT: Yeah, so you have 25-- no, it was-- you have
30 more feet of movement.

00:54:57.450 --> 00:55:00.530
MARISHA: I go back inside for cover.

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:08.495
SAM: It's like she was never there. This crazy
fireball came out, lit a bear on fire and went

00:55:08.495 --> 00:55:09.578
back in the room!

00:55:09.578 --> 00:55:12.280
TRAVIS: Do we have a certain amount of health
potions or anything like that? Like a set number

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.183
of them?

00:55:13.183 --> 00:55:14.395
MATT: What's that, I'm sorry?

00:55:14.395 --> 00:55:16.550
TRAVIS: Did we start with like a set number of
health potions or anything?

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:17.588
Like one each, or two each.

00:55:17.588 --> 00:55:19.399
LAURA: Or is it just what we had on our body?

00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:23.011
MATT: We'll say for the sake of fairness, because
I realize now if one of you guys was the keeper of

00:55:23.011 --> 00:55:25.068
the health potions you'd be way too unfair.

00:55:25.068 --> 00:55:26.445
TRAVIS: Right. I have a shitload.

00:55:26.445 --> 00:55:28.963
LAURA: Yeah, we aren't, but yeah that's true, Grog
always has a bunch.

00:55:28.963 --> 00:55:30.953
MATT: I'd say none of you have health potions on
you right now.

00:55:30.953 --> 00:55:31.911
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:55:31.911 --> 00:55:34.982
MATT: You may have to search the battlefield to
discover things to help you.

00:55:34.982 --> 00:55:39.747
TRAVIS: I'm way too ragey to search for shit.

00:55:39.747 --> 00:55:41.736
MARISHA: I'm sorry for beating up Trinket.

00:55:41.736 --> 00:55:43.312
MATT: All right. Keyleth, that's the end of your
turn?

00:55:43.312 --> 00:55:44.243
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:55:44.243 --> 00:55:45.464
MATT: Okay. Taryon.

00:55:45.464 --> 00:55:47.451
MARISHA: Vex is mad at me.

00:55:47.451 --> 00:55:57.153
SAM: As my action I tear off my patch of Healing
Potions. Now I have four healing potions.

00:55:57.153 --> 00:56:01.205
(laughter)

00:56:01.205 --> 00:56:02.387
MATT: Okay. (laughs)

00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:04.829
TALIESIN: He's a lootdrop. We just have to-- Like
he's like such a lootdrop.

00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:07.057
TRAVIS: Wait, wait. Ten rounds it lasts, right?

00:56:07.057 --> 00:56:10.629
TALIESIN: Not anymore, it's now eight. It's nine
rounds or eight rounds.

00:56:10.629 --> 00:56:16.684
LAURA: Don't, none of us do anything. If we don't
do anything for a minute, Tary's weak.

00:56:16.684 --> 00:56:20.502
MARISHA: That would be so fucked up.

00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:24.160
SAM: Don't believe them, Grog, they'll turn on
you.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:27.123
TRAVIS: Why is there a tapping on this end of the
earpiece?

00:56:27.123 --> 00:56:31.284
TALIESIN: This is such a Community episode: in
eight rounds he dies of exposure. I wait nine

00:56:31.284 --> 00:56:33.841
rounds. (laughs)

00:56:33.841 --> 00:56:37.911
MARISHA: (laughs) That's so true. It's so true.

00:56:37.911 --> 00:56:42.729
MATT: So Tary, you have your four healing potions.

00:56:42.729 --> 00:56:44.241
SAM: Can I take one of them?

00:56:44.241 --> 00:56:45.866
MATT: As a bonus action you can, yeah.

00:56:45.866 --> 00:56:56.128
SAM: I will take one. Yeah! Oh, that's cocked. Ooh!
Ten points, I am whole again.

00:56:56.128 --> 00:56:57.251
MATT: There you go.

00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:58.502
SAM: Great.

00:56:58.502 --> 00:57:00.486
MATT: And you're going to attempt to move?

00:57:00.486 --> 00:57:06.975
SAM: Oh yeah! I mean sure, when Trinket pushed me
do I have momentum that way?

00:57:06.975 --> 00:57:08.414
MATT: The momentum is now going this way.

00:57:08.414 --> 00:57:10.405
SAM: Okay, so I'll turn around and I'll go that
way.

00:57:10.405 --> 00:57:15.191
MATT: You turn around, okay. I'll say you get just
to the edge and you can get ten more feet, that

00:57:15.191 --> 00:57:18.169
direction. As the rest of it carries you onto the
land on the other side.

00:57:18.169 --> 00:57:21.055
That's as far as you get. Okay.

00:57:21.055 --> 00:57:22.052
SAM: Yeah, that's it.

00:57:22.052 --> 00:57:23.853
MATT: That ends your turn. Percival.

00:57:23.853 --> 00:57:27.692
TALIESIN: I'm going to check that chest.

00:57:27.692 --> 00:57:28.999
MATT: Okay.

00:57:28.999 --> 00:57:30.418
TALIESIN: Is that a full action?

00:57:30.418 --> 00:57:31.370
MATT: It is, yes.

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:32.451
TALIESIN: All right.

00:57:32.451 --> 00:57:36.136
MATT: So you go (chest opening) throw the chest
open.

00:57:36.136 --> 00:57:37.336
LAURA: It's a mimic!

00:57:37.336 --> 00:57:40.170
MATT: Ha, shit. No, you do find a greater healing
potion.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:47.818
TALIESIN: I take the greater healing potion. And
then I've got some movement, right, okay. And then

00:57:47.818 --> 00:57:54.024
I go one, two, three, four-- Can I get to behind
that building? Behind the building towards you?

00:57:54.024 --> 00:57:54.842
MATT: Over here?

00:57:54.842 --> 00:58:00.363
TALIESIN: No, no like directly-- Yeah, like as far
over there as possible. I'll come out the door I

00:58:00.363 --> 00:58:05.591
came in. Yeah, over there. And if I have anything
left I'll start walking up the wall. I know I

00:58:05.591 --> 00:58:06.473
won't make it.

00:58:06.473 --> 00:58:09.165
MATT: Okay, you can get to the very top if you
want to.

00:58:09.165 --> 00:58:11.570
TALIESIN: Not quite, next round I'm going to pop
up.

00:58:11.570 --> 00:58:15.188
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you're right there. But
this chest is opened, so I'll turn it to the side

00:58:15.188 --> 00:58:16.629
as a reminder.

00:58:16.629 --> 00:58:18.215
TALIESIN: Knock it prone.

00:58:18.215 --> 00:58:26.877
MATT: Basically. You knocked the chest prone.
Okay! That's the end of your turn, Percival?

00:58:26.877 --> 00:58:28.074
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:58:28.074 --> 00:58:41.775
MATT: All righty. The fiery braziers around
suddenly begin to (explosion) and detonate, as the

00:58:41.775 --> 00:58:49.082
flames inside burst out in a radius. Nobody is
quite in the radius to be affected by them. You

00:58:49.082 --> 00:58:52.861
watch as the corners of the battlefield are
suddenly engulfed in flames briefly. Then the

00:58:52.861 --> 00:58:57.953
flames retract back into just very gently burning
braziers.

00:58:57.953 --> 00:59:01.218
TALIESIN: I love it. This is like Battlebots.

00:59:01.218 --> 00:59:03.588
MATT: Vex, you're up.

00:59:03.588 --> 00:59:08.153
LAURA: Okay, Grog's coming for me.

00:59:08.153 --> 00:59:09.384
TRAVIS: No.

00:59:09.384 --> 00:59:14.369
LAURA: First of all, Trinket's going to just wade
out into that water to get no longer on fire.

00:59:14.369 --> 00:59:18.804
MATT: Okay, well, Trinket first takes three points
of fire damage at the top of the round. Trinket

00:59:18.804 --> 00:59:24.299
wades into the water and does manage to put out
the fire. However, Trinket does take--

00:59:24.299 --> 00:59:26.416
LAURA: Damn it, it's acid or something. What is
it?

00:59:26.416 --> 00:59:28.026
MATT: -- does take six points of acid damage.

00:59:28.026 --> 00:59:30.557
TRAVIS: Ooh, that shit's not water, it's acid!

00:59:30.557 --> 00:59:31.757
MATT: Nope, it is not water.

00:59:31.757 --> 00:59:33.302
TRAVIS: He called that shit poop.

00:59:33.302 --> 00:59:36.664
MATT: As Trinket wades in he goes (acid sounds)
(hurt bear sounds).

00:59:36.664 --> 00:59:39.131
LAURA: No, Trinket goes ow, ow, and then he comes
back out.

00:59:39.131 --> 00:59:42.283
MATT: He gets back out of the water, and he's
like-- you see like the (sizzling) off of him.

00:59:42.283 --> 00:59:46.033
LAURA: Trinket, I didn't even tell you to do that,
you just did that on your own! And then--

00:59:46.033 --> 00:59:47.568
MATT: If a bear could shrug--

00:59:47.568 --> 00:59:53.559
LAURA: Yeah, you know. And then I'm going to get
on my broom--

00:59:53.559 --> 00:59:55.254
MATT: What is a whale?

00:59:55.254 --> 01:00:07.816
LAURA: What's a whale? I get on my broom and I
want to fly up and over, above Grog.

01:00:07.816 --> 01:00:13.605
MATT: Okay, so you (whoosh) over, and as you get
up, you almost bump into the ceiling

01:00:13.605 --> 01:00:15.036
where that tower is.

01:00:15.036 --> 01:00:19.319
LAURA: Actually, could I actually get to Grog if I
was flying?

01:00:19.376 --> 01:00:24.863
MATT: If you were flying from here? You could get
right over there and see him on the ground, yeah.

01:00:24.863 --> 01:00:27.086
LAURA: I couldn't get down to him, though?

01:00:27.086 --> 01:00:29.055
MATT: You could get right down to him.

01:00:29.055 --> 01:00:39.248
LAURA: Oh, this is going to be the worst move ever
if it doesn't work. I'm going to get down to where

01:00:39.248 --> 01:00:45.154
Grog is. This is so stupid, though! No, because if
it doesn't work I can't get away! Because that's

01:00:45.154 --> 01:00:46.449
all my movement, isn't it?

01:00:46.449 --> 01:00:48.151
TRAVIS: Let's team up, you and me.

01:00:48.151 --> 01:00:49.608
MATT: What are you doing?

01:00:49.608 --> 01:00:58.644
LAURA: You want to team up? I go down to Grog and
I say, let's shake on it.

01:00:58.727 --> 01:01:02.780
But I take my necklace
off and I put it into my hand.

01:01:02.780 --> 01:01:07.364
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Oh!

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.351
MATT: Make a deception check.

01:01:09.351 --> 01:01:11.387
TRAVIS: Which is not hard.

01:01:11.387 --> 01:01:19.497
LAURA: Oh, it's a one. Whatever. I still try to
touch it to him. Whatever, he doesn't do it.

01:01:19.497 --> 01:01:21.574
MATT: Right. So Grog, do you accept it?

01:01:21.574 --> 01:01:24.502
TRAVIS: No.

01:01:24.502 --> 01:01:27.679
MATT: Okay. She still touches it to you, but
you're not willing,

01:01:27.679 --> 01:01:30.078
so what's the saving throw on that?

01:01:30.078 --> 01:01:32.571
LAURA: It's a wisdom saving throw.

01:01:32.571 --> 01:01:34.430
TRAVIS: You sneaky.

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.251
LAURA: It's only a ten.

01:01:37.251 --> 01:01:45.105
TRAVIS: That's okay, it's not a high modifier.
That's a five.

01:01:45.105 --> 01:01:55.868
MATT: (suction sound) Grog, you are absorbed into
a familiar dark stony throne room, staring out

01:01:55.868 --> 01:02:02.031
through this small open space, almost like a
personalized movie theater of

01:02:02.031 --> 01:02:03.735
the outside of the necklace.

01:02:03.735 --> 01:02:05.192
TRAVIS: How do I get out?

01:02:05.192 --> 01:02:07.551
LAURA: You can't unless I release you.

01:02:07.551 --> 01:02:16.669
MATT: She has to release you. Mind you, Vex, the
battle cannot be won until all the other people

01:02:16.669 --> 01:02:18.610
have been defeated. This is not considered
defeat.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.071
TALIESIN: You could release him into the acid,
though.

01:02:20.071 --> 01:02:22.004
LAURA: Hey, man. My mind's already there.

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:30.048
MATT: Remember, just be aware, if you're the last
one standing after everything else happens and you

01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:33.334
release Grog, he's going to destroy you, so think
tactically.

01:02:33.384 --> 01:02:42.423
LAURA: Yes, I plan on it, believe me. I'm going to
use my bonus action to stay hidden from... for my

01:02:42.423 --> 01:02:46.576
skirmisher stealth, can I pick a target? I want to
stay hidden from Keyleth.

01:02:46.576 --> 01:02:49.961
MATT: Okay. You cannot, because in order to get
there, your full movement leaves you right in the

01:02:49.961 --> 01:02:54.102
doorway where she can see you. You literally
landed, did that to Grog, and turned over your

01:02:54.102 --> 01:02:56.762
shoulder and see a giant fire elemental looking
right at you.

01:02:56.762 --> 01:02:59.379
LAURA: Great. So I can't use my bonus action to
hide, because she's right there.

01:02:59.379 --> 01:03:01.089
MATT: Yep, because you're not behind anything.

01:03:01.089 --> 01:03:06.872
LAURA: Tight. I'm going to then use my skirmisher
to stay hidden from Percy,

01:03:06.872 --> 01:03:12.698
and I've got nothing I can do.

01:03:12.698 --> 01:03:16.925
TRAVIS: Fuck. Fuck! Like a rat in a cage.

01:03:16.925 --> 01:03:20.553
MATT: You're just (groans).

01:03:20.553 --> 01:03:24.121
TALIESIN: I imagine this as the interior of the
genie bottle from I Dream of Jeannie.

01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:26.587
Pink and plush.

01:03:26.749 --> 01:03:30.753
TRAVIS: Really? I was picturing something from
Saw, like the inside is just awful.

01:03:30.816 --> 01:03:36.126
MATT: The inside is essentially a 20-by-20-foot
cold stone room with a central stone throne, and

01:03:36.126 --> 01:03:40.061
the view you have is this ten-foot-by-five-foot
slit window that looks out from the necklace.

01:03:40.061 --> 01:03:41.338
TRAVIS: Is it fish-eyed?

01:03:41.338 --> 01:03:47.935
MATT: No, it's just a perspective. This is what
Galdrick, the wolf, had been looking through for

01:03:47.935 --> 01:03:56.168
hundreds of years. And what Trinket looks through
whenever he's trapped. That's your turn, Vex.

01:03:56.216 --> 01:03:58.885
Keyleth, you're up. What are you doing?

01:03:58.885 --> 01:04:00.392
MARISHA: Oh shit.

01:04:00.392 --> 01:04:02.912
SAM: It's like prison. You could do some
push-ups.

01:04:02.912 --> 01:04:09.172
TRAVIS: I'm going to Rocky montage this shit.
Wait, are you skipping me?

01:04:09.172 --> 01:04:14.028
MATT: Oh, that's right, you're up next. Grog, what
do you want to do?

01:04:14.028 --> 01:04:21.056
TRAVIS: I'm going to flip the fuck out! I'm inside
of a goddamn box! I'm going to take my Dwarven

01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:25.835
Thrower and throw it as hard as I can at the
window!

01:04:25.835 --> 01:04:28.432
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll an attack.

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:37.108
TRAVIS: Yep. Reckless! Yep. Almost a natural 20.
26.

01:04:37.108 --> 01:04:39.017
MATT: Go ahead and roll damage.

01:04:39.017 --> 01:04:47.980
TRAVIS: Awesome. I'm getting out of here in no
time. 25.

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.540
MATT: All right. Damage?

01:04:50.540 --> 01:04:51.984
TRAVIS: Yeah, 25 damage.

01:04:51.984 --> 01:04:55.478
MATT: Okay. Good. You are also technically sieged
because of your gauntlets.

01:04:55.478 --> 01:04:56.932
TRAVIS: That's right, double damage.

01:04:56.932 --> 01:05:06.212
MATT: All right. As you slam your axe into the
front of this, you watch as the stone (rumble)

01:05:06.212 --> 01:05:10.517
quakes a little bit, and a little bit of dust
(hiss) settles from the ceiling.

01:05:10.517 --> 01:05:12.709
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:13.968
TRAVIS: Oh, really?

01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:16.417
LAURA: He could bust out of the necklace.

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:20.564
TRAVIS: Yeah, this is also Matt Mercer, who had us
fight an entire thing, taking down damage the

01:05:20.564 --> 01:05:27.097
whole time while nothing was happening. I'll take
all three attacks at the window. Reckless.

01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:28.899
MATT: Go ahead and roll attack.

01:05:28.899 --> 01:05:31.881
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:05:31.881 --> 01:05:36.808
LAURA: Does that mean if I put an actual monster
inside of it during the game

01:05:36.808 --> 01:05:38.632
that they could break out?

01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:39.913
SAM: You don't know.

01:05:39.913 --> 01:05:45.999
TALIESIN: They'd have to think of it. I wouldn't
think of attacking the room, and he's designed to

01:05:45.999 --> 01:05:47.131
hurt rooms.

01:05:47.131 --> 01:05:48.795
LAURA: And he's designed to not think.

01:05:48.795 --> 01:05:50.394
MATT: He's designed to make terrible choices.

01:05:50.394 --> 01:05:55.877
TALIESIN: The room could collapse and squish him
like a bug, for all we know.

01:05:55.877 --> 01:05:59.737
TRAVIS: That critical is 55.

01:05:59.737 --> 01:06:03.388
MATT: So that's 110 points of damage with your
siege weaponry.

01:06:03.388 --> 01:06:08.006
LAURA: I'm so dead, you guys. He's going to pop
out!

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:13.898
MATT: As you rear back for your second strike, you
bring your axe to go against this crystalline

01:06:13.898 --> 01:06:20.758
field, this layer that defends you from that. As
you slam it, the axe hits and you watch as it

01:06:20.758 --> 01:06:26.964
spider-cracks (cracking) all across, and the room
(rumbling) is now actively shaking. As you look

01:06:26.964 --> 01:06:30.455
around, you can see that the walls are starting to
crumble, and rocks begin to tumble, and you see

01:06:30.455 --> 01:06:33.124
what looks like a black void behind the cracks
that are opening.

01:06:33.124 --> 01:06:35.316
LAURA: Oh no, that could be really bad.

01:06:35.316 --> 01:06:39.399
MATT: You have a third attack, Grog. What are you
going to do, Mr. Raging?

01:06:39.399 --> 01:06:47.063
TALIESIN: Oh god, I love watching his brain
strain.

01:06:47.063 --> 01:06:49.576
MATT: What are you going to do?

01:06:49.576 --> 01:06:50.493
TRAVIS: Fuck it!

01:06:50.493 --> 01:06:52.209
LAURA: Oh shit!

01:06:52.209 --> 01:06:54.203
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

01:06:54.203 --> 01:06:55.853
MARISHA: No way. You are lying!

01:06:55.853 --> 01:06:57.022
TRAVIS: No, it's true.

01:06:57.022 --> 01:07:01.476
LAURA: What if you get sucked into a random void?
Then we can never defeat you.

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.417
MATT: Roll some damage.

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:07.893
MARISHA: If he gets sucked into a random void, I
imagine that would be considered defeat?

01:07:07.893 --> 01:07:10.589
MATT: Oh, he would be fucking dead.

01:07:10.589 --> 01:07:12.455
TRAVIS: 60 this time, so 120.

01:07:12.455 --> 01:07:21.099
MATT: So 120 points of damage. So Grog. You rear
back once more, and that little bit of doubt in

01:07:21.099 --> 01:07:25.737
the back of your brain, you quickly squash! As
your frenzied fury takes over, you see nothing but

01:07:25.737 --> 01:07:30.564
red, anger, and blood, as you rear back a third
time and (whack). As you slam it, you hear what

01:07:30.564 --> 01:07:36.047
sounds like a thousand windows shattering at once,
and all the walls suddenly collapse in towards

01:07:36.047 --> 01:07:41.061
you, rocketing and spiraling inward. It crushes
into your body as you're thrust forward as the

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:44.647
crystalline structure ahead of you shatters and
pulls you through like a heavy vacuum.

01:07:44.647 --> 01:07:46.878
LAURA: Oh god, he's out!

01:07:46.946 --> 01:07:48.288
SAM: Or he's dead.

01:07:48.288 --> 01:07:55.430
MATT: You suffer 26 points of piercing and
bludgeoning damage.

01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:56.888
TRAVIS: Halved to 13?

01:07:56.888 --> 01:07:58.052
MATT: Halved to 13.

01:07:58.052 --> 01:07:59.216
SAM: That's not bad.

01:07:59.216 --> 01:08:01.214
TRAVIS: And imploded from the inside?

01:08:01.214 --> 01:08:05.468
MATT: And the necklace in front of you
(shattering) shatters off your chest, and you

01:08:05.468 --> 01:08:11.308
watch as a giant Grog, right there into the
hallway, right in front of you.

01:08:11.308 --> 01:08:15.605
MARISHA: Oh shit! So much just happened!

01:08:15.605 --> 01:08:19.872
TRAVIS: Because I reference Terminator 2 later...

01:08:19.872 --> 01:08:27.374
TALIESIN: You punched a hole through time and
space. Well done.

01:08:27.374 --> 01:08:35.072
MATT: Your necklace is gone. It is not functional
for the rest of this battle. I was not expecting

01:08:35.072 --> 01:08:37.420
you to attack the inside of the wall.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:39.876
TRAVIS: I was just going to do it because he's an
idiot, but that really worked!

01:08:39.876 --> 01:08:43.670
MATT: All righty! That ends your turn, Grog.

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:44.514
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:08:44.514 --> 01:08:45.569
MATT: Keyleth, you're up.

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:46.924
LAURA: I was going to release you!

01:08:46.924 --> 01:08:48.358
SAM: In acid!

01:08:48.358 --> 01:09:00.298
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to turn around and be
like (screams, booming) on both of these guys. I'm

01:09:00.298 --> 01:09:12.659
going to move into Vex's space and then attack
Grog. (bam, bam)

01:09:12.659 --> 01:09:15.774
MATT: Go for it. You're technically occupying
Vex's space, right there.

01:09:15.774 --> 01:09:16.890
MARISHA: Correct.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:18.793
MATT: So you attack.

01:09:18.793 --> 01:09:21.718
MARISHA: 15.

01:09:21.718 --> 01:09:23.013
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:09:23.013 --> 01:09:30.457
MARISHA: Second one, much better. That hits. 16
plus six is 22.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:35.934
MATT: 22? That hits, yeah. So go ahead and roll
damage against Vex. Vex, you also catch fire.

01:09:35.934 --> 01:09:39.266
MARISHA: Oh, I'm attacking Grog.

01:09:39.266 --> 01:09:43.790
MATT: Oh, Grog! I misunderstood, sorry. So Grog,
you catch fire. Flames are just (whoosh).

01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:47.994
SAM: You're having a weird six seconds of your
life right now.

01:09:47.994 --> 01:09:57.732
TRAVIS: I know! (panting, warp sound effect,
screaming) Hulk angry!

01:09:57.732 --> 01:10:00.546
MARISHA: That's 20 fire damage.

01:10:00.546 --> 01:10:04.385
MATT: So you take 20 points of fire damage,
reduced to ten, and you're on fire. And you will

01:10:04.385 --> 01:10:08.292
remain on fire, taking 1d10 fire damage every
round, until you spend an action to put it out.

01:10:08.292 --> 01:10:09.579
SAM: But it looks cool.

01:10:09.579 --> 01:10:14.580
MATT: But it looks cool. All right, and because
you moved into Vex's space, Vex, you also catch

01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:21.291
fire automatically. Does she immediately take the
1d10 damage for occupying someone's space?

01:10:21.291 --> 01:10:29.773
MARISHA: The first time it enters a creature's
space on a turn, that creature takes 1d10 fire

01:10:29.773 --> 01:10:31.290
damage and catches fire.

01:10:31.290 --> 01:10:37.811
MATT: Okay. So roll 1d10 damage for Vex.
Technically, both of them, because you had to move

01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:40.906
into both of their spaces to do it, so you take
another 1d10 damage, Grog.

01:10:40.906 --> 01:10:45.034
MARISHA: Five for Vex and four for Grog.

01:10:45.034 --> 01:10:47.820
MATT: All right, so Grog, you take two points of
fire damage. Vex, you take five.

01:10:47.820 --> 01:10:51.743
TRAVIS: Can I make my retaliation strike after her
melee on me?

01:10:51.743 --> 01:10:52.872
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:59.047
TRAVIS: Okay. Reckless! Where's the crit now?
That's what I want to know.

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:03.091
MATT: Actually, that's a valid point. Go ahead and
roll, because he did reckless attack last turn.

01:11:03.091 --> 01:11:04.742
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, you do get advantage.

01:11:04.742 --> 01:11:09.107
MARISHA: Oh, on that first one again? Nope.

01:11:09.107 --> 01:11:11.577
MATT: Okay. So what's your attack roll?

01:11:11.577 --> 01:11:14.715
TRAVIS: It is a 22.

01:11:14.715 --> 01:11:16.835
MATT: Yeah, that hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:11:16.835 --> 01:11:21.471
MARISHA: This is going to hurt.

01:11:21.471 --> 01:11:33.962
TRAVIS: Nah, you're fine. No, that's going to
hurt. I'm just kidding. Yeah, 25. That's it.

01:11:33.962 --> 01:11:36.286
MATT: 25 points of damage to your fire elemental
form.

01:11:36.286 --> 01:11:40.893
MARISHA: Okay. Is that halved because it's
bludgeoning? No, his weapon's magical.

01:11:40.893 --> 01:11:43.957
MATT: You take full damage. However, doesn't he
take damage whenever he...

01:11:43.957 --> 01:11:49.229
MARISHA: Yeah, when he attacks me, he takes
another 1d10 damage.

01:11:49.229 --> 01:11:50.520
TRAVIS: Good to know.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:53.803
MARISHA: Sorry, I'm an asshole. Eight.

01:11:53.803 --> 01:11:59.826
MATT: So you take four points of fire damage. All
righty. Keyleth, so that's your action. You've

01:11:59.826 --> 01:12:04.509
moved 15 feet to get into Vex's and Grog's space.

01:12:04.509 --> 01:12:16.509
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to back out and around
again, through the room.

01:12:16.509 --> 01:12:21.333
MATT: Okay, so that's 15, 20, 25, 30. You're going
to stay in the room?

01:12:21.333 --> 01:12:22.673
MARISHA: Do I have any more?

01:12:22.673 --> 01:12:25.034
MATT: Yes, you have 20 more feet of movement from
here.

01:12:25.034 --> 01:12:29.737
MARISHA: Yeah, let me go out one more and onto
this lip next to Trinket.

01:12:29.737 --> 01:12:30.924
MATT: There?

01:12:30.924 --> 01:12:37.026
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action to
take my Flaming Sphere, and I want to jump it over

01:12:37.026 --> 01:12:43.926
this shallow end on this far side. I've got
cameras right in front of me. It can jump over a

01:12:43.926 --> 01:12:45.533
ten-foot gap.

01:12:45.533 --> 01:12:48.378
MATT: How much does it move?

01:12:48.378 --> 01:12:52.624
MARISHA: 30. Can it get ten more feet over?

01:12:52.624 --> 01:12:57.396
MATT: 25, 30. It'll get just about there.

01:12:57.396 --> 01:13:02.095
MARISHA: To the edge? If it looks like it's not
going to land in the acid, and extinguish it or

01:13:02.095 --> 01:13:03.368
something weird?

01:13:03.368 --> 01:13:05.545
MATT: It looks like it'll probably land in the
acid.

01:13:05.545 --> 01:13:06.741
MARISHA: Would it extinguish it?

01:13:06.741 --> 01:13:07.797
MATT: Probably.

01:13:07.797 --> 01:13:09.299
MARISHA: Then I'll keep it there on the edge.

01:13:09.299 --> 01:13:15.076
MATT: Next round, it can. It doesn't have the
movement for the full jump, unfortunately. So it's

01:13:15.076 --> 01:13:18.734
right there on the edge (fire noises) angrily
burning. I need you to make a concentration check,

01:13:18.734 --> 01:13:22.117
by the way, with advantage, for the damage that
Grog hit you.

01:13:22.117 --> 01:13:27.794
MARISHA: Yeah, I'll take that. 16. What do I have
to get over?

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:31.685
MATT: It's a constitution saving throw, and you
have to beat half his damage that he did to you.

01:13:31.685 --> 01:13:33.198
MARISHA: So he did 25 damage.

01:13:33.198 --> 01:13:34.419
MATT: So 12, half.

01:13:34.419 --> 01:13:35.626
MARISHA: So yeah, I'm good.

01:13:35.626 --> 01:13:38.088
MATT: That ends your turn, Keyleth. Taryon!

01:13:38.088 --> 01:13:48.523
SAM: Oh, hi. I'm going to read my Scroll of Fire
Shield, setting it to a warm shield that will

01:13:48.523 --> 01:13:53.507
protect me from all cold damage and last for ten
minutes.

01:13:53.507 --> 01:13:58.211
TRAVIS: No one can hurt you in there anyway,
right?

01:13:58.211 --> 01:14:00.165
SAM: Oh, but when I get out.

01:14:00.165 --> 01:14:05.573
MATT: Wait, so your Scroll of Fire Shield, you
said?

01:14:05.573 --> 01:14:06.768
SAM: Fire Shield.

01:14:06.768 --> 01:14:15.858
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's ten minutes. Not
concentration. So you said warm shield, which

01:14:15.858 --> 01:14:17.328
gives you resistance to cold damage?

01:14:17.328 --> 01:14:18.278
SAM: Correct.

01:14:18.278 --> 01:14:18.949
MATT: Okay.

01:14:18.949 --> 01:14:22.244
SAM: That's what I want, because I'm already
resistant to fire damage.

01:14:22.244 --> 01:14:30.467
And then I'll roll my ball.

01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:33.130
MATT: All right, you've got 40 feet of movement.

01:14:33.130 --> 01:14:36.474
SAM: I'm just going towards that corner.

01:14:36.474 --> 01:14:37.583
MATT: Here?

01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:52.410
SAM: No, top right. And I'll also pull out my rod
and I'll say, crossbow!

01:14:52.410 --> 01:14:56.068
MATT: (clang) Turns into a nice crossbow.

01:14:56.068 --> 01:14:57.463
SAM: And I'll load it with a bolt.

01:14:57.463 --> 01:15:03.157
MATT: All right. (clicking) That's your turn? All
right! Top of the round.

01:15:03.157 --> 01:15:04.496
Percy, what are you doing?

01:15:04.496 --> 01:15:05.839
TALIESIN: Pulling around the corner.

01:15:05.839 --> 01:15:07.015
MATT: Around here?

01:15:07.015 --> 01:15:07.918
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:15:07.918 --> 01:15:09.074
MATT: All right. You turn the corner.

01:15:09.074 --> 01:15:10.831
TALIESIN: Casting Hex on Grog.

01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:17.217
MATT: Grog is now hexed and on fire.

01:15:17.217 --> 01:15:29.795
TALIESIN: And now I'm going to take a sharpshooter
shot and add a point of grit for an aimed shot to

01:15:29.795 --> 01:15:34.257
the legs. Actually, does that make that harder for
me to shoot him later?

01:15:34.257 --> 01:15:35.950
TRAVIS: I have pretty big legs.

01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:38.608
TALIESIN: No, I mean if you're prone. I can still
shoot him just fine.

01:15:38.608 --> 01:15:42.826
LAURA: Not with sharpshooter, I think. If they're
prone, we don't take disadvantage, right?

01:15:42.826 --> 01:15:45.166
MATT: If they're prone, an attack roll against the
creature has advantage if they're within five

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:48.680
feet. Otherwise it's disadvantage. If the person
is prone, it's harder

01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:50.017
for you to hit with ranged weapons.

01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:53.076
TALIESIN: In that case, I'm going to hold on that
grit, and I'm instead going to use a piercing shot

01:15:53.076 --> 01:16:03.771
with sharpshooter. So for shot number one, with
Animus, sharpshooter. Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:16:03.771 --> 01:16:05.199
TRAVIS: Is that a misfire?

01:16:05.199 --> 01:16:06.811
TALIESIN: It's another misfire.

01:16:06.811 --> 01:16:12.057
MATT: This is not very Percy of you.

01:16:12.057 --> 01:16:19.046
TALIESIN: No. So that needs to be picked up.
That's fine. Irritated, I pull out Bad News and

01:16:19.046 --> 01:16:20.271
take another shot.

01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.684
MATT: Okay. Is this also piercing?

01:16:21.684 --> 01:16:23.027
TALIESIN: This is also piercing.

01:16:23.027 --> 01:16:24.270
MATT: So that's another grit spent.

01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:33.350
TALIESIN: Another grit spent. Oh, thank you.
God damn it... That's better. 22?

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:34.732
MATT: 22, Grog?

01:16:34.732 --> 01:16:36.313
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, that hits. Sorry.

01:16:36.313 --> 01:16:39.447
MATT: So you get to also roll an attack against
Vex, as well.

01:16:39.447 --> 01:16:40.834
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:16:40.834 --> 01:16:46.818
MATT: Basically, the shot goes through both of
you. It goes through Grog's shoulder (explosion)

01:16:46.818 --> 01:16:50.099
and has enough weight to actually impact and hit
Vex in the same shot.

01:16:50.099 --> 01:16:53.273
TALIESIN: Thankfully, it can't misfire when I do
this. 16.

01:16:53.273 --> 01:16:54.496
LAURA: No.

01:16:54.496 --> 01:16:59.832
MATT: So you watch as the muscle of the shoulder
explodes, and in that brief second you dodge your

01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:03.949
head out of the way, and watch as the ball goes
(whoosh) and skims the edge of your cheek. A

01:17:03.949 --> 01:17:06.466
little blood goes (flick) down the side.

01:17:06.466 --> 01:17:10.235
LAURA: I glare at Percy, from under Grog's
armpit.

01:17:10.235 --> 01:17:13.203
MATT: You glare at him through the hole in his
shoulder, Tombstone-style.

01:17:13.203 --> 01:17:17.329
TRAVIS: Grog doesn't understand why you're so mad
at his shoulder.

01:17:17.329 --> 01:17:29.548
TALIESIN: Aw, shit. So that's (counting). That's
33 points of piercing damage.

01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:33.558
MATT: 33 points of piercing damage. That's 16.

01:17:33.558 --> 01:17:37.681
TALIESIN: Plus four necrotic damage.

01:17:37.681 --> 01:17:39.634
MATT: Four necrotic, not halved.

01:17:39.634 --> 01:17:46.865
TALIESIN: And I'm going to take my last shot.
Actually, I'm going to take a Retort shot, because

01:17:46.865 --> 01:17:53.372
this is the fucking day I'm having, and I'm going
to burn another grit, and I'm going to try and

01:17:53.372 --> 01:17:55.653
knock him prone, because you're welcome.

01:17:55.653 --> 01:17:58.942
TRAVIS: You just have a thing for me today.

01:17:58.942 --> 01:18:10.965
TALIESIN: That, too. This is another sharpshooter
with Retort. Ugh, that's a 16.

01:18:10.965 --> 01:18:13.343
MARISHA: Snitch is failing you tonight.

01:18:13.343 --> 01:18:16.343
TALIESIN: 16 to hit.

01:18:16.343 --> 01:18:17.542
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:18.693
TALIESIN: Goddamn it.

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:23.839
MATT: This time you turn around and see Percy
there. He pulls out the Retort shot, and you're

01:18:23.839 --> 01:18:26.589
like (whoosh) and duck right out of the way.

01:18:26.589 --> 01:18:31.291
TALIESIN: I'm diving back behind the bloody
doorway, goddamn it.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:33.884
MATT: Okay. That's about the extent of your
movement, there.

01:18:33.884 --> 01:18:35.567
TALIESIN: Yep. That did not go well.

01:18:35.567 --> 01:18:37.786
MATT: All righty. That ends your turn.

01:18:37.786 --> 01:18:47.439
TALIESIN: Yep. Oh, you have a disadvantage on
wisdom saving throws right now. Wisdom checks.

01:18:47.439 --> 01:18:49.796
TRAVIS: Because of Hex? Wisdom saves?

01:18:49.796 --> 01:18:55.863
MATT: Not saving throws, checks. So insight,
perception, things like that.

01:18:55.863 --> 01:18:58.270
TRAVIS: Most things that I normally suck balls at
anyway.

01:18:58.270 --> 01:19:00.281
TALIESIN: I want to make sure you really suck at
them right now.

01:19:00.281 --> 01:19:11.550
MATT: All right. The pillars that you see in the
center here begin to (vibration) emit that weird,

01:19:11.550 --> 01:19:17.821
vibrating hum again, and you feel, Keyleth, as the
gravitational pull warps around you but doesn't

01:19:17.821 --> 01:19:21.056
affect your form, because of your Freedom of
Movement.

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:24.592
TALIESIN: Like the Matrix.

01:19:24.592 --> 01:19:34.279
MATT: However, Trinket seems to (groans) be pulled
down by the gravity of it. You watch as Doty's

01:19:34.279 --> 01:19:40.318
form on the ground across the way, (crack) gravity
crushes a little further in towards the stone.

01:19:40.318 --> 01:19:43.985
TRAVIS: Is it anything inside of the four pillars
or in circles around each pillar?

01:19:43.985 --> 01:19:52.056
MATT: It seems to be radial around each pillar.
All right. Vex, you're up.

01:19:52.056 --> 01:19:55.125
TALIESIN: I take two psychic damage on top of
that. I forgot about that.

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:56.731
LAURA: I'm going to put myself out.

01:19:56.731 --> 01:20:01.320
MATT: Okay. So you put yourself out as an action?
Okay. First thing, at the top of your round, you

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:06.734
take four points of fire damage. You spend the
action to put yourself out, so you are now no

01:20:06.734 --> 01:20:07.969
longer on fire.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.595
LAURA: I'm going to disengage.

01:20:09.595 --> 01:20:10.911
MATT: That's a bonus action. From Grog?

01:20:10.911 --> 01:20:15.432
LAURA: Yes. And I'm going to kick off the ground
and fly up as high as I can.

01:20:15.432 --> 01:20:18.760
TRAVIS: You can disengage now? Son of a bitch.

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:28.089
MATT: Rogues, man. So you can get up about...
we'll say 40 feet. Yeah, you're up near the top,

01:20:28.089 --> 01:20:29.189
straight up.

01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:33.067
LAURA: I want to be over the roof of the building
below me.

01:20:33.067 --> 01:20:46.380
MATT: Okay, so you get a little ways over. We'll
say about... there. Ends your turn?

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.112
Grog, you're up.

01:20:48.112 --> 01:20:49.520
TRAVIS: How high is Vex?

01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:52.243
MATT: She's about 40 feet up from you right now.

01:20:52.243 --> 01:21:01.061
TRAVIS: Okay. I'm on fire.

01:21:01.061 --> 01:21:05.561
MATT: Yeah. So you take three points of fire
damage, reduced to one.

01:21:05.561 --> 01:21:19.834
TRAVIS: I am going to stay on fire, because fuck
it, and I am going to use my max speed to advance

01:21:19.834 --> 01:21:21.258
towards Percy.

01:21:21.258 --> 01:21:33.270
MATT: Okay. So you turn. All right, you're
advancing towards Percy. (counting)

01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:40.238
TRAVIS: With my bonus action, can I use my Boots
of Feral Leaping to jump 20 feet horizontally in

01:21:40.238 --> 01:21:42.068
the direction of Percy?

01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:43.681
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.912
TALIESIN: All right.

01:21:45.912 --> 01:21:50.109
MATT: Go ahead and roll your check to see if you
succeed or not.

01:21:50.109 --> 01:21:57.484
TRAVIS: Yeah. 19.

01:21:57.484 --> 01:22:04.496
MATT: You land right on the opposite side of
Percy. We'll push this open just a little bit to

01:22:04.496 --> 01:22:10.226
get your placement as you slam into the ground
right next to him. (heavy impact). All of a

01:22:10.226 --> 01:22:17.304
sudden, Percival, you're standing against the wall
and you hear (footsteps). Nothing. (explosion)

01:22:17.304 --> 01:22:22.784
Right to the right of you, the sudden slam of
stone, as the behemoth goliath Grog lands next

01:22:22.784 --> 01:22:28.500
to you, grinning, blood pouring out of the bullet
wound in his shoulder, big smile.

01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:36.936
TRAVIS: Can I stick my finger in the bullet wound
hole and taste it and go, hi. And can I take all

01:22:36.936 --> 01:22:41.505
three attacks, reckless, great weapon master, the
whole smash.

01:22:41.505 --> 01:22:43.899
MATT: Yes, you may.

01:22:43.899 --> 01:22:45.960
SAM: If that was the real Percy!

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.732
TRAVIS: I know! Some phantom bastard.

01:22:48.732 --> 01:22:51.238
TALIESIN: I'm only nine hit points down.

01:22:51.238 --> 01:22:56.778
TRAVIS: Oh, this is the hammer, so I don't have
great weapon master.

01:22:56.778 --> 01:22:59.408
MATT: No, you took Blood Axe, didn't you?

01:22:59.408 --> 01:23:01.559
TALIESIN: No, you went to hammer.

01:23:01.559 --> 01:23:06.124
TRAVIS: Yeah, I've been using the hammer. 28.

01:23:06.124 --> 01:23:08.459
TALIESIN: 28 hits.

01:23:08.459 --> 01:23:17.323
TRAVIS: Good to hear. That's a 26 for the first
one.

01:23:17.323 --> 01:23:19.390
MATT: 26 points of damage to you.

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:21.623
TALIESIN: 26 points of damage? Okay.

01:23:21.623 --> 01:23:25.403
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:23:25.403 --> 01:23:27.014
TALIESIN: Fuck.

01:23:27.014 --> 01:23:36.049
TRAVIS: (giggling) I don't know what's happening.
That's not part of the plan. Hey, that's okay,

01:23:36.049 --> 01:23:38.362
that's only a two, plus a lot.

01:23:38.362 --> 01:23:42.882
MATT: So you rolled a what? What did you roll for
damage?

01:23:42.882 --> 01:23:46.164
TRAVIS: Well, the dice landed on a two, plus my
modifier.

01:23:46.164 --> 01:23:48.955
MATT: Well, hold on. What level fighter are you?

01:23:48.955 --> 01:23:51.503
TRAVIS: Two?

01:23:51.503 --> 01:23:53.679
MATT: Right, which means...

01:23:53.679 --> 01:23:55.651
TRAVIS: Oh, I can re-roll a one or two for
damage.

01:23:55.651 --> 01:23:58.157
MATT: Yep. That's the great weapon fighting.

01:23:58.157 --> 01:23:59.765
TALIESIN: Fuck, dude. All right.

01:23:59.765 --> 01:24:00.929
TRAVIS: Thank you, Matthew.

01:24:00.929 --> 01:24:02.985
MATT: You haven't used that yet, really.

01:24:02.985 --> 01:24:07.519
TRAVIS: That's cocked. That's an eight.

01:24:07.519 --> 01:24:17.008
SAM: He likes to hit things.

01:24:17.008 --> 01:24:19.395
TRAVIS: 72 points of damage.

01:24:19.395 --> 01:24:22.537
TALIESIN: Is that everything so far? Is that
rolled into what you just did?

01:24:22.537 --> 01:24:24.183
TRAVIS: That's just the second hit.

01:24:24.183 --> 01:24:25.996
MATT: Wait, so how much is that?

01:24:25.996 --> 01:24:29.165
TRAVIS: Well, it was a 24. 24 points of damage.

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.594
MATT: You double the dice, not the bonus.

01:24:31.594 --> 01:24:35.313
TRAVIS: Double the dice. Okay. Not the modifier,
too?

01:24:35.313 --> 01:24:41.119
MATT: No, just the dice. So you rolled an eight,
so it's 16, plus the modifier.

01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:47.898
TRAVIS: 32.

01:24:47.898 --> 01:24:49.970
MATT: Plus your brutal critical.

01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:51.914
TRAVIS: Which is another damage dice.

01:24:51.914 --> 01:24:58.485
MATT: Which is another three additional damage
dice at level 17, Grog. Well, no, because you're

01:24:58.485 --> 01:25:01.116
not a level 17 barbarian, so it is two. You're
right.

01:25:01.116 --> 01:25:06.466
TRAVIS: Right. Yeah. That's a ten. That's a nine.

01:25:06.466 --> 01:25:10.025
MATT: So, that's two. An additional 19 to the 30.

01:25:10.025 --> 01:25:11.517
SAM: 51.

01:25:11.517 --> 01:25:14.364
TALIESIN: 51 points, so I'm at 26. 51.

01:25:14.364 --> 01:25:16.522
TRAVIS: Third.

01:25:16.522 --> 01:25:22.571
TALIESIN: I have a Hail Mary at the end of this.
We'll see how it goes.

01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:24.113
TRAVIS: 27 to hit?

01:25:24.113 --> 01:25:25.746
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:30.354
TRAVIS: That's only 19 points of damage.

01:25:30.354 --> 01:25:35.125
TALIESIN: Okay, I actually have to do the math to
see. I don't think I'm unconscious. No, I'm not,

01:25:35.125 --> 01:25:36.243
but that hurt.

01:25:36.243 --> 01:25:38.097
MARISHA: You're close, though.

01:25:38.097 --> 01:25:40.595
SAM: That was 76 points of damage.

01:25:40.595 --> 01:25:44.000
TALIESIN: I'm going to do the math with a
calculator--

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:50.918
MATT: 76 plus 19? Right? The last hit was 19
points of damage? So 76 total before that.

01:25:50.918 --> 01:26:01.036
TALIESIN: 26, 51, and 19. I've taken 105 points of
damage. I have 35 points remaining.

01:26:01.036 --> 01:26:03.628
SAM: He's fine!

01:26:03.628 --> 01:26:06.009
TALIESIN: I'm at 35.

01:26:06.009 --> 01:26:08.761
MATT: He did 96, wait.

01:26:08.761 --> 01:26:11.145
TALIESIN: I'm at 140 points. I have 140 hit
points.

01:26:11.145 --> 01:26:12.954
MATT: Right. Sorry, just doing the math here.

01:26:12.954 --> 01:26:15.696
TALIESIN: I also had nine points of damage from
psychic damage from my own fucking gun.

01:26:15.696 --> 01:26:23.525
MATT: Oh, total! I see. Okay. Grog, not a bad
round. You did 96 points of damage!

01:26:23.525 --> 01:26:28.456
TRAVIS: (heavy footfalls, impact noise)

01:26:28.456 --> 01:26:33.414
MATT: All right! So, that's Grog's turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

01:26:33.414 --> 01:26:37.303
MARISHA: (heavy breathing) Okay, Vex is flying.

01:26:37.303 --> 01:26:39.805
MATT: Vex is flying up on the top, on her broom.

01:26:39.805 --> 01:26:41.383
SAM: You're all alone.

01:26:41.383 --> 01:26:44.815
MARISHA: I'm going to take my bonus action, go
ahead and get this out of the way first, to get my

01:26:44.815 --> 01:26:49.463
Flaming Sphere over that gap and ram it into
Trinket.

01:26:49.463 --> 01:26:53.202
LAURA: You are so cruel.

01:26:53.202 --> 01:26:55.519
MATT: Have Trinket roll a dexterity saving throw.

01:26:55.519 --> 01:26:58.543
MARISHA: I'm a druid. I'm sorry! I feel bad about
this.

01:26:58.543 --> 01:27:02.869
LAURA: 16!

01:27:02.869 --> 01:27:05.523
MATT: Nope! 5d6 points of fire damage on Trinket.

01:27:05.523 --> 01:27:12.038
LAURA: I have a feeling this going to kill him.
Oh, and I don't have the necklace anymore!

01:27:12.038 --> 01:27:13.260
MATT: Nope!

01:27:13.260 --> 01:27:15.356
SAM: Oh, so he'll just be dead?

01:27:15.356 --> 01:27:17.234
LAURA: Or unconscious.

01:27:17.234 --> 01:27:21.961
MARISHA: Six, 12, 18, 22 damage.

01:27:21.961 --> 01:27:26.479
LAURA: 21 points is what he had. Trinket is
unconscious.

01:27:26.479 --> 01:27:35.160
MATT: Unconscious and burning. Smoke (sizzling)
off the burnt fur. (sad bear sounds)

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:37.025
MARISHA: Okay, I still have my full movement,
right?

01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:39.043
MATT: Full movement and action; that was just your
bonus action.

01:27:39.043 --> 01:27:45.139
TRAVIS: Do I take any extra damage because I
didn't put the fire out at the end of the round?

01:27:45.139 --> 01:27:52.074
MATT: No, it's at the top of your round that you
take the damage. Oh, and Percy? Roll concentration

01:27:52.074 --> 01:27:53.216
checks for Hex.

01:27:53.216 --> 01:27:56.263
TALIESIN: Oh, I took how many points of damage?

01:27:56.263 --> 01:27:58.390
MARISHA: You could roll a natural 20 and save it.

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:59.612
TALIESIN: I could roll a natural 20.

01:27:59.612 --> 01:28:02.918
MATT: So first attack, just roll higher than a 14,
we'll say.

01:28:02.918 --> 01:28:04.499
TALIESIN: No.

01:28:04.499 --> 01:28:05.779
MATT: Okay, Hex is gone.

01:28:05.779 --> 01:28:07.666
TALIESIN: Hex gone.

01:28:07.666 --> 01:28:10.898
MATT: Hex-a-gone! All right. Keyleth, what are you
doing?

01:28:10.898 --> 01:28:19.506
MARISHA: I'm going to haul ass. Do I have enough
movement if I dash, or whatever,

01:28:19.506 --> 01:28:21.751
to get into that building?

01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:22.658
MATT: Over here?

01:28:22.658 --> 01:28:23.699
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:28:23.699 --> 01:28:29.568
MATT: Speed of 50, right? You can try, I don't
want to tell you if you can or not. You can try to

01:28:29.568 --> 01:28:30.724
figure it out.

01:28:30.724 --> 01:28:36.251
MARISHA: (counting) Yeah, I'll try it.

01:28:36.251 --> 01:28:38.849
SAM: You're good at jumping over bodies of water.

01:28:38.849 --> 01:28:46.171
MARISHA: I'm not going over water, man!
Can I peek in?

01:28:46.238 --> 01:28:52.275
MATT: You get just there on the inside. You see,
it's largely empty and there is a chest that's

01:28:52.275 --> 01:28:54.640
currently open and looks empty.

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:56.179
MARISHA: Cool!

01:28:56.179 --> 01:29:02.572
MATT: You see, as you're running by, a large
hammer over the top of the wall on the opposite

01:29:02.572 --> 01:29:16.716
side going (thuds). These heavy, wet thuds. All
right, so that's your movement. You have your

01:29:16.716 --> 01:29:18.229
action, still.

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:35.691
MARISHA: Oh, right! Oh my god! Okay. I'm going to
use my action to expend a level-2 spell slot to

01:29:35.691 --> 01:29:45.375
heal myself. With my spell slot to heal myself in
wild shape thing.

01:29:45.375 --> 01:29:49.100
MATT: Right. It's a bonus action to do that, which
you already used to move your sphere.

01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:53.388
MARISHA: I can't use my action? I'm basically
wasting an action to do it instead.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:54.724
MATT: Sure.

01:29:54.724 --> 01:30:04.943
MARISHA: Okay. Where are my d8s? Here they are.
That's not great.

01:30:04.943 --> 01:30:07.286
I heal nine hit points in my form.

01:30:07.286 --> 01:30:08.752
TRAVIS: That's great.

01:30:08.752 --> 01:30:13.658
MARISHA: Thanks, man. I'm glad you're so
approving.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:14.783
MATT: Taryon.

01:30:14.783 --> 01:30:15.796
SAM: Me?

01:30:15.796 --> 01:30:18.139
MATT: Yes. You're there in the corner with your
crossbow.

01:30:18.139 --> 01:30:26.018
SAM: Yep. I'm going to-- crossbow in one hand, I'm
going to take my broom and stick it between my

01:30:26.018 --> 01:30:28.726
legs. Ready to go.

01:30:28.726 --> 01:30:31.927
LAURA: Is there room for that? How big is that
damn orb?

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:33.062
SAM: I don't know. Matt?

01:30:33.062 --> 01:30:42.478
MATT: The broom isn't huge. You can fit it up
inside there. Take that quote out of context.

01:30:42.478 --> 01:30:44.384
(laughter)

01:30:44.384 --> 01:30:46.962
MATT and LAURA: You can fit it up inside there.

01:30:46.962 --> 01:30:52.848
SAM: And then I will continue my movement. Where
am I? Am I that thing in the corner?

01:30:52.848 --> 01:30:54.586
MATT: You're right here, way over in the corner.

01:30:54.586 --> 01:30:56.920
SAM: I'm going to go around the wall so nobody can
see me.

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:58.938
MATT: Okay. Five, ten, 15.

01:30:58.938 --> 01:31:13.168
SAM: Right next to the fireball of death, yeah.
I'll stay there, and then I'll try something. It's

01:31:13.168 --> 01:31:14.118
not going to work.

01:31:14.118 --> 01:31:15.348
MATT: What are you going to try?

01:31:15.348 --> 01:31:16.452
SAM: I don't think it'll work.

01:31:16.452 --> 01:31:17.666
MATT: What are you trying, Tary?

01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:26.933
SAM: Secretly, I'm going to take a patch off my
robe, a window patch, and see if I can make a

01:31:26.933 --> 01:31:29.348
window to climb through the sphere.

01:31:29.348 --> 01:31:33.698
(laughter)

01:31:33.698 --> 01:31:39.710
SAM: I don't think so. It says no effects can pass
through the sphere. I assume no effects can affect

01:31:39.710 --> 01:31:41.815
the sphere, either.

01:31:41.815 --> 01:31:46.364
MATT: I'm going to make a judgment call here,
based on the wording. Give me just one second.

01:31:46.364 --> 01:31:49.828
TRAVIS: Can you drop it prematurely if you want
to, whenever you want?

01:31:49.828 --> 01:31:55.772
SAM: No, I'm trapped in here. Trapped for a
minute.

01:31:55.772 --> 01:31:58.949
TRAVIS: You're in the bomb shelter. You don't
know.

01:31:58.949 --> 01:32:01.395
SAM: They'll let me out when they're ready.

01:32:01.395 --> 01:32:10.633
MATT: Can pass through the sphere...

01:32:10.633 --> 01:32:14.268
SAM: I don't think it's going to work.

01:32:14.268 --> 01:32:17.274
TALIESIN: It's kind of brilliant.

01:32:17.274 --> 01:32:24.037
MATT: I'm going to say sure. It's not passing
through it, it's creating

01:32:24.037 --> 01:32:28.575
a passable window in the sphere.

01:32:28.575 --> 01:32:29.993
TRAVIS: I like the ruling.

01:32:29.993 --> 01:32:31.845
MATT: It makes sense.

01:32:31.845 --> 01:32:33.717
SAM: I'm going to hover out a little.

01:32:33.717 --> 01:32:38.105
MATT: So you go ahead and pull it off and slap it,
and you watch as a little two-foot-by-two-foot

01:32:38.105 --> 01:32:39.339
window opens up.

01:32:39.339 --> 01:32:43.514
SAM: I'm not going to leave yet. I'm staying
in the safety of the sphere for at least one more

01:32:43.514 --> 01:32:46.334
round, ready to go.

01:32:46.334 --> 01:32:49.141
LAURA: I really hope the fire pillar goes off.

01:32:49.141 --> 01:32:50.574
SAM: I'm still in the sphere!

01:32:50.574 --> 01:32:52.218
LAURA: Yeah, but you've got a hole in it.

01:32:52.218 --> 01:32:54.025
SAM: Yeah, I realize that.

01:32:54.025 --> 01:32:57.418
TRAVIS: (explosion, screams)

01:32:57.418 --> 01:33:00.668
MARISHA: Come on, fire pillars, come on!

01:33:00.668 --> 01:33:15.099
MATT: All righty. Yeah, technically... nah,
it's too late now to retcon that. My fault.

01:33:15.159 --> 01:33:19.414
All right, so. That ends your turn, Tary?
Percival, you're up.

01:33:19.414 --> 01:33:25.436
TALIESIN: Oh here's a hail Mary. First thing I'm
going to do is I'm going to use my bonus action to

01:33:25.436 --> 01:33:30.023
down a potion of greater healing, which is how
many d4?

01:33:30.023 --> 01:33:33.249
MATT: Greater healing is 4d4 plus four.

01:33:33.249 --> 01:33:41.450
TALIESIN: 4d4 plus four. Let's make that happen.
That's okay.

01:33:41.450 --> 01:33:43.609
MARISHA: Yeah, that's not a bad roll.

01:33:43.609 --> 01:33:47.831
TALIESIN: 15 points of healing.

01:33:47.831 --> 01:33:51.678
MARISHA: Yeah, not bad.

01:33:51.678 --> 01:33:54.183
TALIESIN: That's one hit from Grog that I can now
take.

01:33:54.183 --> 01:33:56.324
MARISHA: Yeah, might keep you alive.

01:33:56.324 --> 01:34:01.722
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and hit him with
Diplomacy. Since I'm technically in grappling

01:34:01.722 --> 01:34:12.453
distance, I can't shoot, and if I try to move,
he's going to hit me, so I'm going to attempt to hit

01:34:12.453 --> 01:34:14.655
him with Diplomacy and see what happens.

01:34:14.655 --> 01:34:15.850
MATT: Okay. All right.

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.878
TALIESIN: What is that, since I haven't used
it...

01:34:18.878 --> 01:34:21.155
MATT: What does it say on the card?

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:31.103
TALIESIN: Where is the card? I have a lot of them
out. It's a dex-based unarmed melee attack. Just

01:34:31.103 --> 01:34:32.205
dex modifier?

01:34:32.205 --> 01:34:38.935
MATT: Yeah, just dex modifier. Well, no. I'd say
add your proficiency, as well, because you built

01:34:38.935 --> 01:34:39.795
the thing.

01:34:39.795 --> 01:34:47.629
TALIESIN: Add the proficiency bonus? Okay, thank
you. That's less of a hail Mary. Slightly. Oh my

01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:49.107
god. 14.

01:34:49.107 --> 01:34:51.516
MARISHA: Oh, buddy! No.

01:34:51.516 --> 01:34:54.459
TALIESIN: I've rolled three ones and a two this
game.

01:34:54.459 --> 01:34:55.902
TRAVIS: That's unreal.

01:34:55.902 --> 01:34:57.234
MATT: So that's one attack.

01:34:57.234 --> 01:35:01.011
TALIESIN: Another round with it?

01:35:01.011 --> 01:35:06.837
MATT: Yeah. So Percy's (frustrated grunting)
trying to reach out towards you.

01:35:06.837 --> 01:35:09.474
TALIESIN: 17?

01:35:09.474 --> 01:35:10.990
TRAVIS: That's my AC.

01:35:10.990 --> 01:35:20.960
TALIESIN: Okay! That's 2d12 electrical damage.

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.269
MATT: Lightning damage to you, so that's halved.

01:35:25.269 --> 01:35:29.742
TALIESIN: That's 24 points of lightning damage.

01:35:29.742 --> 01:35:31.336
MATT: So you take 12 points.

01:35:31.336 --> 01:35:38.774
TALIESIN: Guess what. Make a constitution saving
throw.

01:35:38.774 --> 01:35:41.227
TRAVIS: Which I have disadvantage on?

01:35:41.227 --> 01:35:43.289
LAURA, MATT, and TALIESIN: No.

01:35:43.289 --> 01:35:44.955
MATT: Constitution saving throw.

01:35:44.955 --> 01:35:46.804
TALIESIN: You actually no longer have
disadvantage.

01:35:46.804 --> 01:35:48.204
MATT: Yeah, Hex went away.

01:35:48.204 --> 01:35:51.060
TRAVIS: Okay. That's a 27.

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.567
TALIESIN: You have a 27?

01:35:52.567 --> 01:35:54.787
TRAVIS: My constitution is amazing. Fuck.

01:35:54.787 --> 01:35:56.155
MARISHA: He's a fucking barbarian.

01:35:56.155 --> 01:35:57.676
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so fucked.

01:35:57.676 --> 01:36:01.340
SAM: Does it do anything to him?

01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:03.918
TALIESIN: Nope. It doesn't do what I was hoping it
was going to do.

01:36:03.918 --> 01:36:05.548
That would've saved my goddamned life.

01:36:05.548 --> 01:36:07.193
MATT: If he would've rolled low, that would've
saved you, probably.

01:36:07.193 --> 01:36:08.338
TALIESIN: Yeah, if he had rolled low.

01:36:08.338 --> 01:36:09.661
MARISHA: Does he take any damage?

01:36:09.661 --> 01:36:15.098
TALIESIN: He takes 12 points of lightning damage.
What the fuck else am I going to do?

01:36:15.098 --> 01:36:17.864
MARISHA: That's just Grog putting his finger in
the socket.

01:36:17.864 --> 01:36:24.512
TALIESIN: I can run like a motherfucker. Let's
see.

01:36:24.512 --> 01:36:33.397
TRAVIS: I had an action surge I forgot about last
time, so consider this borrowed time.

01:36:33.397 --> 01:36:39.036
MATT: Technically, you had advantage on your
attacks against him because he used reckless.

01:36:39.104 --> 01:36:43.970
TALIESIN: But I can't use my gun, can I? Oh wait,
I would've had advantage, but I didn't get

01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:45.439
advantage on the--

01:36:45.439 --> 01:36:48.651
MATT: You would've had advantage, so the two
attack rolls we'll say were one attack.

01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:52.301
TALIESIN: I can't hit him with my gun, but I can
still hit him with my sword.

01:36:52.301 --> 01:36:54.232
MATT: Well, you can hit him with the gun. You just
have disadvantage with the strikes, but you have

01:36:54.232 --> 01:36:55.783
advantage, so it would be just a straight roll.

01:36:55.783 --> 01:37:00.534
TALIESIN: Okay. So I have two more sword attacks,
and then I've got to figure out some shit. Let's

01:37:00.534 --> 01:37:01.670
take two--

01:37:01.670 --> 01:37:03.102
LAURA: Wait, you have four attacks?

01:37:03.102 --> 01:37:05.523
TALIESIN: I have three attacks. But I had
advantage, so technically that was one attack.

01:37:05.523 --> 01:37:06.937
LAURA: Oh!

01:37:06.937 --> 01:37:09.019
TALIESIN: So I'm going to take two sword attacks.

01:37:09.019 --> 01:37:11.935
TRAVIS: Come on, man. You got this.

01:37:11.935 --> 01:37:19.339
TALIESIN: No, I don't. That's a 27 piercing.

01:37:19.339 --> 01:37:22.723
MARISHA: Wait, are you rolling damage?

01:37:22.723 --> 01:37:30.421
TALIESIN: No, I'm sorry. That's to hit. I'm sorry,
my brain is-- you're scaring me. 25 to hit and 21

01:37:30.421 --> 01:37:31.694
to hit, so both hit?

01:37:31.694 --> 01:37:32.986
MATT: Both hit, yeah.

01:37:32.986 --> 01:37:35.035
SAM: Most of your war paint is gone, by the way,
Travis.

01:37:35.035 --> 01:37:36.623
MARISHA: How did that happen?

01:37:36.623 --> 01:37:38.534
TRAVIS: I absorb things that make me stronger.

01:37:38.534 --> 01:37:41.430
(laughter)

01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:47.545
TALIESIN: (counting) 22 points of piercing
damage.

01:37:47.545 --> 01:37:50.373
MATT: Okay, so 11 points piercing damage, Grog.

01:37:50.373 --> 01:37:51.831
TRAVIS: Thank you.

01:37:51.831 --> 01:38:02.773
TALIESIN: And I'm going to burn an action surge.
You can't use an action to disengage unless you

01:38:02.773 --> 01:38:04.400
have it. I'm just fucked, aren't I?

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.472
MATT: Correct. You can still run, but he gets to
swipe at you.

01:38:06.472 --> 01:38:10.778
TALIESIN: I'm going to take my heal with that
action surge. I'm going to heal up.

01:38:10.778 --> 01:38:20.640
MARISHA: Going to hold down the fort? You're
looking down the barrel, man.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:32.070
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know. That's awful. 14 points of
healing, but it'll get me away.

01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:34.107
TRAVIS: Can I take my retaliation strike?

01:38:34.107 --> 01:38:35.410
MATT: Yes, you can.

01:38:35.410 --> 01:38:39.183
SAM: Oh no.

01:38:39.183 --> 01:38:41.372
TRAVIS: 26?

01:38:41.372 --> 01:38:44.242
TALIESIN: 26 to hit? Hits.

01:38:44.242 --> 01:38:48.385
MARISHA: So fucking nonchalant, like he doesn't
know.

01:38:48.385 --> 01:38:50.112
TRAVIS: 24.

01:38:50.112 --> 01:38:57.038
TALIESIN: 24. Okay. That's his reaction, so I can
run now.

01:38:57.038 --> 01:38:58.156
TRAVIS: You may flee.

01:38:58.156 --> 01:38:59.813
TALIESIN: Oh. Well, that's fine.

01:38:59.813 --> 01:39:01.299
MATT: (laughs) You can flee.

01:39:01.299 --> 01:39:05.053
TRAVIS: Or you can stand here and face it, like a
man.

01:39:05.053 --> 01:39:16.355
TALIESIN: Yeah, you'll be laughing when I'm far
away from you. I've got to get some distance. I'm

01:39:16.355 --> 01:39:18.843
going to start running straight up the tower.

01:39:18.843 --> 01:39:20.337
MARISHA: He can still hit you if you run.

01:39:20.337 --> 01:39:21.746
TRAVIS: I already did.

01:39:21.746 --> 01:39:26.263
MATT: (counting) That's as far as you can get with
your movement.

01:39:26.263 --> 01:39:27.735
TALIESIN: That'll do.

01:39:27.735 --> 01:39:30.735
SAM: Is there an entrance to the tower there?

01:39:30.735 --> 01:39:32.480
MATT: There's two doors and a ladder.

01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:34.861
TALIESIN: I don't need a ladder, though.

01:39:34.861 --> 01:39:36.211
MATT: No, you can run up the side.

01:39:36.211 --> 01:39:38.318
TALIESIN: I don't want to go around that wall. I
want to go &lt;i&gt;up&lt;/i&gt; that wall.

01:39:38.318 --> 01:39:39.618
MATT: Up this wall?

01:39:39.618 --> 01:39:40.714
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:39:40.714 --> 01:39:42.406
MATT: So you're right there.

01:39:42.406 --> 01:39:44.484
SAM: Cat on a hot tin roof.

01:39:44.484 --> 01:39:46.251
MATT: That's your turn, Percy?

01:39:46.251 --> 01:39:48.727
TALIESIN: That's the end of my fucking turn.

01:39:48.727 --> 01:39:57.161
MATT: The electrical towers at the top cycle
(electricity noises) and flash with a bolt of

01:39:57.161 --> 01:40:04.107
energy. Nobody is in the radius to be affected; no
effect. That brings us to Vex. Up at the top, as

01:40:04.107 --> 01:40:08.529
you flew up there on the broom, you felt your head
and shoulders bump and hit the ceiling, and you're

01:40:08.693 --> 01:40:10.573
like, shit. Arrows ready.

01:40:10.573 --> 01:40:18.788
LAURA: Welp. I can see Percy, so I'm going to
Hunter's Mark him.

01:40:18.788 --> 01:40:20.488
TALIESIN: All right.

01:40:20.488 --> 01:40:22.843
LAURA: And then I'm going to attack him.

01:40:22.843 --> 01:40:28.097
SAM: The love of your life. Bathtub buddy.

01:40:28.097 --> 01:40:34.628
LAURA: This first attack. Well, let's see. Oh
yeah, that hits. Yeah, that definitely hits, 31.

01:40:34.628 --> 01:40:38.535
And it's a bramble shot.

01:40:38.535 --> 01:40:39.782
MATT: Okay.

01:40:39.782 --> 01:40:43.822
(laughter)

01:40:43.822 --> 01:40:48.325
LAURA: So you have to roll a strength DC.

01:40:48.325 --> 01:40:51.026
TALIESIN: I have to roll a strength check against
bramble?

01:40:51.026 --> 01:40:55.262
MATT: First, roll damage for everything.

01:40:55.262 --> 01:40:56.527
LAURA: For the regular?

01:40:56.527 --> 01:40:57.654
MATT: For all of it.

01:40:57.654 --> 01:41:00.834
LAURA: Oh right. Okay, wait. That's an additional
4d8.

01:41:00.834 --> 01:41:07.524
TALIESIN: Shit. Yeah, no. I'm fucked, anyway.

01:41:07.524 --> 01:41:09.112
SAM: Maybe not.

01:41:09.112 --> 01:41:12.683
TRAVIS: Hey, man. Better to be done by your lover
than by me. I left that action surge out.

01:41:12.683 --> 01:41:17.215
TALIESIN: Oh, I have another action surge that I
didn't-- I was hoping.

01:41:17.215 --> 01:41:26.661
LAURA: (adding) 38, plus six lightning damage.

01:41:26.661 --> 01:41:34.215
TALIESIN: 38 plus six lightning damage? And then
I'm going to take... ugh, this is the worst I've

01:41:34.215 --> 01:41:39.968
ever rolled in my life. 38 plus six lightning. I'm
going to bring that down to 25 points of damage.

01:41:39.968 --> 01:41:41.206
MATT: From?

01:41:41.206 --> 01:41:47.886
TALIESIN: From the Gloves of Missile Snaring. So
38 down to 25. Plus six lightning damage?

01:41:47.886 --> 01:41:50.264
Still alive.

01:41:50.264 --> 01:41:56.397
MATT: As you're on the wall, you feel the sense,
this burning in your ears, and you glance up just

01:41:56.397 --> 01:42:01.503
as you watch an arrow (arrow sound) come towards
you and as it bursts open, this series of tendrils

01:42:01.503 --> 01:42:05.933
of vines, you reach over and grab and stop the
arrow, somewhat, before it pierces into you, but

01:42:05.933 --> 01:42:10.491
you still manage to pull it back and the vines
begin to ensnare around you. Go ahead and roll a

01:42:10.491 --> 01:42:15.891
strength saving throw, I believe?

01:42:15.891 --> 01:42:17.055
TALIESIN: 16?

01:42:17.088 --> 01:42:20.401
MATT: DC 17. They (whoosh) wrap around you and you
find yourself--

01:42:20.401 --> 01:42:24.000
TALIESIN: Actually, this is better. I'm so sorry.
Strength saving throw, 22.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.160
MATT: That does succeed. So as they wrap around
you, you (strained grunting) and burst off of them

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:33.730
and the arrow breaks out and they all turn gray
and wither into dust as they hit the ground.

01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:36.553
LAURA: You're so strong, darling. I'm so
impressed.

01:42:36.553 --> 01:42:38.598
Right as I throw another arrow at him.

01:42:38.598 --> 01:42:41.742
(laughter)

01:42:41.742 --> 01:42:43.884
LAURA: That's a 25 to hit.

01:42:43.884 --> 01:42:45.517
MATT and TALIESIN: That hits.

01:42:45.517 --> 01:42:49.745
LAURA: I'm going to do another... no, I'm not. I'm
not going to do a bramble shot on him. I'm just

01:42:49.745 --> 01:42:50.961
going to do a regular shot.

01:42:50.961 --> 01:42:52.426
TALIESIN: No, it's smart.

01:42:52.426 --> 01:42:54.166
LAURA: Well, yeah, he's taking half damage.

01:42:54.166 --> 01:42:56.871
TALIESIN: I'm bleeding out. I'm just blood.

01:42:56.871 --> 01:43:00.830
LAURA: Oh wait, do you only get to use the catch
once?

01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:04.292
TALIESIN: Once per turn. It's a reaction.

01:43:04.292 --> 01:43:10.821
LAURA: 12, 14, 16 plus six lightning damage.

01:43:10.821 --> 01:43:12.219
TALIESIN: I'm out.

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:21.603
MATT: You fall unconscious and off the wall,
hitting the ground. You take three points of

01:43:21.603 --> 01:43:24.489
bludgeoning damage as you hit, which is an
immediate failed death save.

01:43:24.489 --> 01:43:25.918
TALIESIN: Are we doing death saves?

01:43:25.918 --> 01:43:27.471
MATT: Oh yeah, that's part of this.

01:43:27.471 --> 01:43:30.809
MARISHA: So you could theoretically recover and
come back.

01:43:30.809 --> 01:43:34.790
MATT: Yeah, if you roll a natural 20 on your death
save. It's happened before.

01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:43.492
LAURA: Fuck, okay. Those are my two attacks, so
can I fly down to the ground behind the

01:43:43.492 --> 01:43:50.885
building... actually, they're all over on the
other side. I'm going to drop down where I am.

01:43:50.885 --> 01:43:53.713
MATT: Okay. Drop down to the roof?

01:43:53.713 --> 01:44:02.337
LAURA: Yeah, to the roof. And I'm going to lay
down on the roof and use my bonus action to hide.

01:44:02.337 --> 01:44:07.432
MATT: Okay, you lay down on the roof, using your
bonus action to hide.

01:44:07.432 --> 01:44:10.812
Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

01:44:10.812 --> 01:44:12.121
LAURA: 27.

01:44:12.121 --> 01:44:17.189
MATT: 27. As far as you know, no one has any idea
where the hell you are. All right, that ends your

01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:18.892
turn. Grog, you're up.

01:44:18.892 --> 01:44:23.838
TRAVIS: I see Vex...

01:44:23.838 --> 01:44:25.592
MATT: You watch her (descending noise).

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:32.369
TRAVIS: But she was shooting at my quarry. I turn
the corner towards where Percy is.

01:44:32.369 --> 01:44:38.723
MATT: As you lumber around, you go and see his
unconscious body there, on the ground.

01:44:38.815 --> 01:44:46.643
TRAVIS: (gasps) Percy von Fredrickstein de blah,
skittles and balls and ass. What happened?

01:44:46.643 --> 01:44:49.759
TALIESIN: He burns an action doing this, I
assume.

01:44:49.759 --> 01:44:52.234
(laughter)

01:44:52.234 --> 01:44:56.233
TRAVIS: Spin the hammer, right down on his head.

01:44:56.233 --> 01:45:03.172
MATT: Okay, you move in. That's ten more feet. Go
ahead and roll, with advantage.

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:09.801
TRAVIS: (laughing) That's a 32.

01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:12.724
MATT: All right. It's an auto-crit because it was
within five feet. How do you want to do this?

01:45:12.799 --> 01:45:22.276
TRAVIS: I start to swing down. Did he get new
glasses? I take them. (heavy impact)

01:45:22.276 --> 01:45:28.663
(laughter)

01:45:28.663 --> 01:45:32.520
MATT: The whole face caves in as the hammer
scatters him like a Gallagher watermelon across

01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:33.942
the stone floor.

01:45:33.942 --> 01:45:36.315
TRAVIS: Oh, I can see very well.

01:45:36.315 --> 01:45:38.209
(laughter)

01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:41.381
MATT: Percival is no more. First to fall.

01:45:41.381 --> 01:45:43.664
TRAVIS: How much speed did I use?

01:45:43.664 --> 01:45:49.699
MATT: Five, ten, 15, 20.

01:45:49.699 --> 01:45:51.272
TRAVIS: 20.

01:45:51.272 --> 01:45:54.829
MARISHA: And the sound of the first cannon.

01:45:54.829 --> 01:46:01.343
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to leap, with
the feral leaping, 20 feet toward the tower?

01:46:01.343 --> 01:46:03.124
MATT: Toward the tower this way?

01:46:03.124 --> 01:46:04.290
TRAVIS: Entrance, down.

01:46:04.290 --> 01:46:07.115
MATT: Yeah, if you want to. Go ahead and roll for
that.

01:46:07.115 --> 01:46:14.104
TRAVIS: 21.

01:46:14.104 --> 01:46:19.672
MATT: You land (grunt, impact noise) right toward
the base.

01:46:19.672 --> 01:46:23.061
TRAVIS: Can I use the remainder of my speed to run
up the tower?

01:46:23.061 --> 01:46:24.744
MARISHA: And he's still on fire, right?

01:46:24.744 --> 01:46:27.489
TRAVIS: Yep. Oh, I need to take the fire damage.

01:46:27.489 --> 01:46:31.264
MATT: That's true. Last round, or just this one?

01:46:31.264 --> 01:46:33.654
TRAVIS: Just this one. I took it last time.

01:46:33.654 --> 01:46:36.121
MATT: That's five fire damage, reduced to two.

01:46:36.121 --> 01:46:39.239
TRAVIS: Two. On fire.

01:46:39.239 --> 01:46:44.792
MATT: And you disappear into the center of the
tower.

01:46:44.792 --> 01:46:46.696
TRAVIS: 20 feet in?

01:46:46.696 --> 01:46:48.452
MATT: You get partway up the stairs.

01:46:48.452 --> 01:46:49.646
TRAVIS: Is it a winding thing?

01:46:49.646 --> 01:46:54.256
MATT: Yeah, it's a spiral staircase. All right,
that ends your turn, Grog. Keyleth?

01:46:54.256 --> 01:46:58.402
MARISHA: Okay, I saw Vex shooting Percy?

01:46:58.402 --> 01:47:03.375
MATT: No, you were inside the cusp of this
building the entire time. Glancing around there,

01:47:03.375 --> 01:47:08.366
you saw her up there, and make a perception
check.

01:47:08.366 --> 01:47:19.911
MARISHA: Okay. 20. No, 21.

01:47:19.911 --> 01:47:26.656
MATT: 21. You got the gist. You watched her
descend, but you have no idea directly where she

01:47:26.656 --> 01:47:29.148
is. You know she's somewhere in this area.

01:47:29.148 --> 01:47:32.874
MARISHA: Okay. So I don't see anyone?

01:47:32.874 --> 01:47:36.995
MATT: You know where she is. If you have an area
something you want to do, you could probably hit

01:47:36.995 --> 01:47:41.017
her, but you can't aim a specific attack directly
at her because you can't see her.

01:47:41.017 --> 01:48:08.522
MARISHA: Okay. I am going to start by moving my
fire ball. Jeez. There's not a lot I can do. I saw

01:48:08.522 --> 01:48:10.914
Grog run by, as well, correct?

01:48:10.914 --> 01:48:16.658
MATT: You saw Grog run by this way, and that's the
last you saw. And you know that Vex is somewhere

01:48:16.658 --> 01:48:21.013
in this area. What do you want to do?

01:48:21.013 --> 01:48:26.370
MARISHA: I'm going to move out and around on this
side, my movement over here.

01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:28.595
MATT: You're there.

01:48:28.595 --> 01:48:35.925
MARISHA: I'm going to go ahead and use my bonus
action to heal a little bit more. Actually, no,

01:48:35.925 --> 01:48:40.807
can I use my action to heal like last time and use
my bonus action to move my sphere?

01:48:40.807 --> 01:48:50.302
MATT: Sure. Yeah, okay, go for it. Technically...
yeah, it's fine.

01:48:50.302 --> 01:49:00.825
MARISHA: I'm going to do 1st-level. Five. Okay.
And then I'm going to move my sphere right in

01:49:00.825 --> 01:49:02.600
front of the doorway.

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:03.954
MATT: 30 feet for the sphere?

01:49:03.954 --> 01:49:05.936
MARISHA: Yeah, however far it can go.

01:49:05.936 --> 01:49:11.455
MATT: There, that's as far as it can get right
there. Okay, that ends your turn, Keyleth?

01:49:11.455 --> 01:49:18.677
MARISHA: Do I have any more movement? I'll pop
back in the building a little bit, and that's it.

01:49:18.677 --> 01:49:21.631
MATT: All righty. Taryon, your turn.

01:49:21.631 --> 01:49:25.683
TRAVIS: How many rounds is this? Four? Five?

01:49:25.683 --> 01:49:26.795
LAURA: This is the sixth round.

01:49:26.795 --> 01:49:28.067
SAM: This is the fifth round.

01:49:28.067 --> 01:49:30.172
LAURA: This is the fifth round. After this will be
the sixth.

01:49:30.172 --> 01:49:48.273
SAM: Invisibility. And I want to fly out of the
sphere and to a vantage point of your choosing, so

01:49:48.273 --> 01:49:55.560
no one knows where I am, somewhere between 20 and
40 feet high, maybe towards the center-ish of the

01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:58.165
game field. Up to you where.

01:49:58.165 --> 01:50:00.678
MATT: Okay, I know where you are. That's your
turn?

01:50:00.678 --> 01:50:01.668
SAM: Yes.

01:50:01.668 --> 01:50:02.915
MATT: Okay, Taryon.

01:50:02.915 --> 01:50:04.259
TRAVIS: Do you know where?

01:50:04.259 --> 01:50:07.173
SAM: No, I don't want to know where I am so you
don't know where I am.

01:50:07.173 --> 01:50:08.480
LAURA: It's smart.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:13.408
(laughter)

01:50:13.408 --> 01:50:18.338
MATT: No longer Percy's turn. So with that, the
braziers--

01:50:18.338 --> 01:50:22.653
SAM: And Matt. Away from the things that blow up.
Was that understood?

01:50:22.653 --> 01:50:29.014
MATT: Right, yes. And all the braziers flare up.
Don't affect anybody. That brings us to Vex.

01:50:29.014 --> 01:50:35.948
LAURA: I'm going to take off from the roof and try
to make it to the opposite tower.

01:50:35.948 --> 01:50:38.964
MATT: The opposite tower, flying over here?

01:50:38.964 --> 01:50:39.917
LAURA: Yeah.

01:50:39.917 --> 01:50:42.314
MATT: You make your way there.

01:50:42.314 --> 01:50:44.584
LAURA: Can I see anything?

01:50:44.584 --> 01:50:52.478
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:50:52.732 --> 01:50:55.600
LAURA: 20.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:59.620
MATT: Yeah, you see the flickering flames of
Keyleth within the inside, in the very cusp of

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:02.216
this. She has three-quarters cover, but you have
sharpshooter, so you ignore that.

01:51:02.216 --> 01:51:09.498
LAURA: Well, then I'll try to hit her. I'm going to
attack her! That's a 27.

01:51:09.498 --> 01:51:11.020
MATT and MARISHA: That hits.

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:26.449
LAURA: Eight plus five is-- no, is it? No. 13? 15,
plus four lightning damage.

01:51:26.449 --> 01:51:29.063
And then I'm going to do it again.

01:51:29.063 --> 01:51:31.679
MATT: 17 points of damage.

01:51:31.679 --> 01:51:42.400
LAURA: I'm going to do a bramble shot on her,
because I only did the one. 25 to hit.

01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:46.175
MATT: 25 to hit? That hits. Damage?

01:51:46.175 --> 01:52:05.097
LAURA: (counting) 32, plus three lightning
damage.

01:52:05.097 --> 01:52:07.884
TRAVIS: 35, damn.

01:52:07.884 --> 01:52:13.740
MATT: As the brambles wrap around her, the flames
burn them away. She's immune to being restrained.

01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:22.400
LAURA: Yeah, I figured. I bet Tary's up here, but
I don't know that. I'm going to use my bonus

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:30.332
action to hide. I was hidden at the beginning of
the turn, but I'm assuming my movement took me out

01:52:30.332 --> 01:52:36.309
of hiding. Can I use my skirmisher's stealth to
choose a quarry to stay hidden? Or I have to be

01:52:36.309 --> 01:52:37.860
hidden at the top of the turn?

01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:42.786
MATT: At this point, yeah. We're skirting a line,
here, of watching you go up and land. You aren't

01:52:42.786 --> 01:52:49.201
amongst trees in a forest. It's easy to see where
you are, vaguely.

01:52:49.201 --> 01:52:50.848
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to hide.

01:52:50.922 --> 01:52:53.815
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

01:52:53.815 --> 01:52:56.255
LAURA: Only 18.

01:52:56.255 --> 01:52:59.256
MATT: Okay, good to know. That ends Vex's turn.
Grog!

01:52:59.256 --> 01:53:09.060
TRAVIS: Right. I don't see any immediate chests in
this big tower, right? It's just a stairwell?

01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:13.500
MATT: No, it's just stairwell. Like when you went
through the other one, it's empty, more of a

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:17.310
gaining of ground and/or protective space.

01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:24.392
TRAVIS: All right. Live and let die,
motherfuckers! Can I run out of the tower,

01:53:24.392 --> 01:53:27.518
straight towards the pool of acid?

01:53:27.518 --> 01:53:35.106
MATT: You got ten feet in, so ten feet out. You still
have 40 at the doorway. There's a Flaming Sphere

01:53:35.106 --> 01:53:37.148
there, which you're like, "oh, avoid!"

01:53:37.148 --> 01:53:42.170
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm aiming to try and make my way to
this structure.

01:53:42.170 --> 01:53:48.762
MATT: 25, 30, 35, 40. You're just stepping over
the corpse of Trinket.

01:53:48.762 --> 01:53:50.336
TRAVIS: Lovely.

01:53:50.336 --> 01:53:54.742
LAURA: Oh, I forgot he's just unconscious. He's
not dead yet. I haven't been making saving throws

01:53:54.742 --> 01:53:57.660
for him.

01:53:57.660 --> 01:54:01.177
MATT: He's doing okay for now. Grog, that's your
movement.

01:54:01.244 --> 01:54:10.601
TRAVIS: I raise my hammer as I get to Trinket. I
don't give a shit about Trinket.

01:54:10.601 --> 01:54:17.238
What square am I on?

01:54:17.238 --> 01:54:24.355
MATT: You're technically right here. You have your
action, still. You can dash if you want to get all

01:54:24.355 --> 01:54:27.150
the way there, or you can attack something in the
vicinity. What do you want to do?

01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:31.882
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll dash.

01:54:31.882 --> 01:54:45.955
MATT: (counting) You get inside here and see a
small chest by the doorway there.

01:54:45.955 --> 01:54:47.681
TRAVIS: Can I move to the chest?

01:54:47.681 --> 01:54:50.264
MATT: You can move to the chest, but it'll take an
action to open it.

01:54:50.264 --> 01:54:54.609
TRAVIS: Can I use my action surge, which I have
not used, to open the chest?

01:54:54.609 --> 01:55:01.910
MATT: Yes, you can. You do. You open it up, and
there is a potion bottle within it. So you acquire

01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:04.788
the potion. You open the chest and you grab the
potion.

01:55:04.788 --> 01:55:08.056
TRAVIS: Right, and I can't do anything else? Can I
consume it?

01:55:08.056 --> 01:55:09.848
MATT: You have your bonus action, still, right?

01:55:09.848 --> 01:55:12.796
TRAVIS: Yeah! That's right. Chug-a-lug, bitches.

01:55:12.796 --> 01:55:14.264
MATT: So 4d4 plus four.

01:55:14.264 --> 01:55:18.627
TRAVIS: Gimme some squares. No, 4d4. I need some
triangles.

01:55:18.627 --> 01:55:21.619
MATT: You also take six points of fire damage,
reduced to three.

01:55:21.619 --> 01:55:25.363
Because you're doing this while on fire.

01:55:25.363 --> 01:55:38.746
TRAVIS: Yeah. 4d4 plus four. 14 points. That's my
turn.

01:55:38.746 --> 01:55:40.772
MAT: Okay, Grog's done. Keyleth?

01:55:40.772 --> 01:55:48.097
MARISHA: Okay. (grunts) Going to go ahead and drop
my fire elemental form. It's looking pretty rough

01:55:48.097 --> 01:55:54.299
now. Hope I don't fuck that up. And I'm going to
peek around the corner and I can see

01:55:54.299 --> 01:55:56.432
Vex a little up on the tower.

01:55:56.496 --> 01:55:58.351
MATT: Make a perception check.

01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:02.936
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil, don't fuck me! Oh,
that's good! 29.

01:56:02.936 --> 01:56:07.268
MATT: You glance up the tower, and you see just
the edge of Vex trying to hide around the

01:56:07.268 --> 01:56:10.615
stonework. You see her feather and the edge of her
hair, and you see her right up on the top.

01:56:10.615 --> 01:56:17.524
MARISHA: I'll be like, (yelling) your blue feather
is very pretty against the stonework!

01:56:17.524 --> 01:56:19.194
LAURA: We have earrings, dear.

01:56:19.194 --> 01:56:21.522
(laughter)

01:56:21.522 --> 01:56:28.438
MARISHA: I yell it through the earring, and it
deafens her a little bit. (yelps) Ow, feedback.

01:56:28.509 --> 01:56:33.227
LAURA: Do I hear Tary go (yelps) anywhere?

01:56:33.227 --> 01:56:34.299
MATT: No.

01:56:34.299 --> 01:56:39.661
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my Spire of
Conflux, and just to be sure, I'm going to call a

01:56:39.661 --> 01:56:47.883
Fire Storm down and blanket the tower, and I want
to go down a little bit. So here's what I want.

01:56:47.883 --> 01:56:52.425
I want this.

01:56:52.425 --> 01:56:58.287
MATT: The Fire Storm down the side? How many cubes
is it?

01:56:58.287 --> 01:57:01.890
MARISHA: Rain fire down everywhere.

01:57:01.890 --> 01:57:09.189
MATT: That's nasty. Okay, Fire Storm. Ten ten-foot
cubes.

01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:16.589
MARISHA: Because I don't know where Tary is. I
haven't seen him in a while.

01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:21.449
MATT: You could even get to Grog, if you wanted
to.

01:57:21.449 --> 01:57:23.448
MARISHA: It's a fire waterfall.

01:57:23.448 --> 01:57:29.741
MATT: Yeah, it is. It's very Minecraft. (fire
noises) All right, I need you to go ahead and make

01:57:29.741 --> 01:57:33.283
a dexterity saving throw, Vex. And Marisha, roll
7d10.

01:57:33.283 --> 01:57:35.237
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:57:35.237 --> 01:57:36.839
TRAVIS: 7d10?!

01:57:36.839 --> 01:57:39.484
MATT: Yeah, that's the damage of Fire Storm, man.

01:57:39.484 --> 01:57:40.796
LAURA: 20.

01:57:40.796 --> 01:57:42.241
MATT: What's your DC?

01:57:42.241 --> 01:57:45.018
MARISHA: Well, my spell DC is 20.

01:57:45.018 --> 01:57:50.831
MATT: So you succeed, so half damage. Just barely
succeeded.

01:57:50.831 --> 01:57:57.344
MARISHA: I get to reroll ones. Do you have one
more?

01:57:57.344 --> 01:57:59.036
TALIESIN: Yeah, in my bag.

01:57:59.036 --> 01:58:04.666
MATT: The front doors, by the way, of this tower?
Are now on fire. The wooden doors at the bottom

01:58:04.666 --> 01:58:08.883
have now caught flame from the Fire Storm, and
you can see elements of the inside the tower are

01:58:08.883 --> 01:58:10.660
starting to catch fire, too.

01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:13.809
TRAVIS: Shit, so the passage through them
would...

01:58:13.809 --> 01:58:15.190
LAURA: How many? 10d10?

01:58:15.190 --> 01:58:16.920
MATT and MARISHA: 7d10.

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:20.145
MATT: And you get to reroll ones once because of
your staff.

01:58:20.145 --> 01:58:40.093
MARISHA: No ones, but it's a pretty good roll.
(counting) 26.

01:58:40.093 --> 01:58:41.329
SAM: 27.

01:58:41.329 --> 01:58:55.894
MARISHA: (continues counting) 52.

01:58:55.894 --> 01:58:58.007
MATT: So you take 26 points of fire damage.

01:58:58.007 --> 01:58:59.150
LAURA: All right.

01:58:59.150 --> 01:59:00.977
MARISHA: Was Tary in there, at all?

01:59:00.977 --> 01:59:01.915
MATT: No.

01:59:01.915 --> 01:59:03.021
MARISHA: Fuck!

01:59:03.021 --> 01:59:04.235
TRAVIS: He was?! Or he was not?

01:59:04.235 --> 01:59:05.258
MATT: No.

01:59:05.258 --> 01:59:06.784
SAM: I honestly have no idea.

01:59:06.784 --> 01:59:09.005
TRAVIS: When you moved, you said, "I go to you
know where?"

01:59:09.005 --> 01:59:11.834
SAM: No, I said, you pick me a place. I don't want
to know.

01:59:11.834 --> 01:59:13.746
LAURA: He knows where, but nobody else does.

01:59:13.746 --> 01:59:19.091
MATT: Based on your specifications and the movement
of the broom, yes. I know where you are.

01:59:19.091 --> 01:59:26.655
MARISHA: And I'm going to take my bonus action. I
know Grog ran vaguely in this direction, so I'm

01:59:26.655 --> 01:59:34.201
going to take my 30 feet of movement of my Flaming
Sphere and move it toward that tower that Grog is

01:59:34.201 --> 01:59:36.588
towards. Yeah, is that 30 feet?

01:59:36.588 --> 01:59:37.890
MATT: Yeah, it's 30 feet there.

01:59:37.890 --> 01:59:41.452
MARISHA: And then I'm going to pop back into
cover, hug against the wall.

01:59:41.452 --> 01:59:45.149
MATT: All righty, that brings us to Taryon!

01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:52.212
SAM: Hi. I lose Invisibility if I cast a spell.

01:59:52.212 --> 01:59:53.624
MATT: Yes, or attack something.

01:59:53.624 --> 01:59:56.988
SAM: Or attack something. Does drinking something
count as casting a spell?

01:59:56.988 --> 01:59:57.897
MATT: Nope.

01:59:57.897 --> 02:00:11.045
SAM: I will drink a Swift-Step Draught, increasing
my walking speed now to 60, plus my Boots of

02:00:11.045 --> 02:00:13.414
Speed, which makes it 120.

02:00:13.414 --> 02:00:14.590
MATT: Yeah.

02:00:14.590 --> 02:00:17.880
SAM: I'm the fastest motherfucker on the planet.

02:00:17.880 --> 02:00:24.325
MATT: Well, next to Vax. Not on the broom, though.
It's your walking speed.

02:00:24.325 --> 02:00:37.740
SAM: No, I know. Just for future rounds, would
dropping a Smoke Stick count as an attack? It

02:00:37.805 --> 02:00:41.697
doesn't hurt anyone; it just makes some smoke.

02:00:41.697 --> 02:00:42.752
MATT: No.

02:00:42.752 --> 02:00:45.601
SAM: What about dropping a Tanglefoot Bag?

02:00:45.601 --> 02:00:48.216
MATT: That's starting to borderline on an attack.

02:00:48.216 --> 02:00:52.644
SAM: Okay! I just want to know my options here.
All right, cool. I think that's it.

02:00:52.644 --> 02:00:55.625
MATT: You're not too sure. You can try it.

02:00:55.625 --> 02:01:01.425
SAM: The speed thing. And oh, can you just tell
me, without telling me where I am, do I know the

02:01:01.425 --> 02:01:03.761
location of Keyleth?

02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:04.847
MATT: Yes.

02:01:04.847 --> 02:01:07.852
SAM: Okay. And do I know the location of
everybody?

02:01:07.907 --> 02:01:14.881
MATT: Yes. You watched Grog run past, you watched
Vex get set fire in a tower, and you watched

02:01:14.881 --> 02:01:17.268
Keyleth cast the spell and then disappear inside
the room.

02:01:17.268 --> 02:01:18.230
SAM: Okay.

02:01:18.230 --> 02:01:19.394
TALIESIN: Is Vex on fire again?

02:01:19.394 --> 02:01:24.794
MATT: She's not caught fire, but you watched
flames consume her briefly. (laughs) It seems to

02:01:24.794 --> 02:01:25.806
be a theme.

02:01:25.806 --> 02:01:27.013
SAM: All right, just move me around.

02:01:27.013 --> 02:01:36.523
MATT: Okay. That's your turn, Taryon. All right,
top of the round. The arcane towers burst. I need

02:01:36.523 --> 02:01:38.068
you to make a dexterity saving throw.

02:01:38.068 --> 02:01:45.259
LAURA: Motherfuck. Oh, that's great; that
definitely saves. 30.

02:01:45.259 --> 02:01:51.395
MATT: 30? Okay, that would be 11 points of
lightning damage, reduced to five.

02:01:51.395 --> 02:01:52.525
LAURA: Okay.

02:01:52.525 --> 02:02:00.170
MATT: All right. Vex, your turn. As the flames
subside, you're like (pants). You glance over and

02:02:00.170 --> 02:02:02.892
you can see Keyleth vanish back inside that room.

02:02:02.892 --> 02:02:05.617
LAURA: (groans) But I can't see her? I can't see
anybody from where I am?

02:02:05.617 --> 02:02:09.889
MATT: Currently, you have no view of her, but you
just watched her just barely step inside. You can

02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:13.608
still get perspective if you were to move to get a
better angle.

02:02:13.608 --> 02:02:16.294
TALIESIN: This board was designed to actually fuck
with the two of us, because we don't have any good

02:02:16.294 --> 02:02:18.563
long-distance shots but they have nothing but
cover.

02:02:18.563 --> 02:02:20.627
LAURA: There's nowhere for us to hide!

02:02:20.627 --> 02:02:28.470
MATT: There's plenty of places for you guys to
hide. There's nothing but hiding places!

02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:42.042
LAURA: No, I know. It's ground hiding. I'm going
to fly up towards you, Matthew.

02:02:42.042 --> 02:02:44.004
MATT: Okay, over here?

02:02:44.004 --> 02:02:45.128
LAURA: Yes.

02:02:45.128 --> 02:02:45.954
MATT: Okay.

02:02:45.954 --> 02:02:48.249
LAURA: And I'm going to hover right there. Wait,
can I see Keyleth?

02:02:48.249 --> 02:02:50.073
MATT: You can barely see Keyleth out of the side,
yeah.

02:02:50.073 --> 02:02:52.296
LAURA: Okay, but three-quarters, and I can still
attack her?

02:02:52.296 --> 02:02:55.322
MATT: Yes, because you have sharpshooter, so you
can attack her.

02:02:55.322 --> 02:02:58.170
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to attack her. She's in
that building.

02:02:58.170 --> 02:03:07.282
MATT: You get to about there. You can look down
and you see her poking out.

02:03:07.282 --> 02:03:10.586
LAURA: I want to be low enough that at the end of
my movement I can drop down to the ground.

02:03:10.586 --> 02:03:12.158
MATT: Okay, I see.

02:03:12.158 --> 02:03:15.817
LAURA: I mean, drop down to the roof. Yeah.

02:03:15.817 --> 02:03:22.409
MATT: Yeah, so we'll say you can be there. You can
get down to the roof and see her from there.

02:03:22.409 --> 02:03:28.815
LAURA: (laughing) Yeah. That works, too! She's
still Hunter's Marked from before, isn't she?

02:03:28.815 --> 02:03:31.457
MARISHA: Did you ever Hunter's Mark me?

02:03:31.457 --> 02:03:33.734
MATT: You Hunter's Marked Grog, I thought.

02:03:33.734 --> 02:03:35.515
LAURA: I Hunter's Marked Percy.

02:03:35.515 --> 02:03:37.201
MATT: Percy. That's what it was. Yeah.

02:03:37.201 --> 02:03:39.527
LAURA: Then I'm going to move my Hunter's Mark to
Keyleth.

02:03:39.527 --> 02:03:41.112
MATT: Keyleth as a bonus action.

02:03:41.112 --> 02:03:46.621
LAURA: Oh, wait. That's a bonus action, just to
move it?

02:03:46.621 --> 02:03:47.567
MATT: Yeah.

02:03:47.567 --> 02:03:49.200
LAURA: Okay, then never mind. I'm not going to do
that.

02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:50.522
MATT: I'm pretty sure it is.

02:03:50.522 --> 02:03:52.671
LAURA: It probably is; I'm not going to do it.

02:03:52.671 --> 02:03:53.734
MATT: Okay.

02:03:53.734 --> 02:03:55.141
LAURA: 26 to hit.

02:03:55.141 --> 02:03:56.413
MATT: 26 hits.

02:03:56.413 --> 02:03:57.625
LAURA: Okay.

02:03:57.625 --> 02:03:58.973
MATT: So you're not Hunter's Marking her?

02:03:58.973 --> 02:03:59.990
LAURA: No.

02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:01.150
MATT: Okay.

02:04:01.150 --> 02:04:12.891
LAURA: 16, plus five lightning damage. And I'm
going to hit her again.

02:04:12.891 --> 02:04:21.612
MATT: 16 plus nine. Roll a concentration check.
With advantage.

02:04:21.612 --> 02:04:24.718
MARISHA: Oh yeah. I'm good. I rolled a natural
19.

02:04:24.718 --> 02:04:25.850
MATT: Yeah, you're fine.

02:04:25.850 --> 02:04:27.519
LAURA: And the second attack is 30.

02:04:27.519 --> 02:04:33.300
MATT: Hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:04:33.300 --> 02:04:35.933
LAURA: 16 plus four lightning damage.

02:04:35.933 --> 02:04:41.627
MATT: That's 20 points of damage. Go ahead and
roll another concentration check. Just roll higher

02:04:41.627 --> 02:04:42.954
than a ten.

02:04:42.954 --> 02:04:48.204
MARISHA: With my modifier, right? With my bonus?

02:04:48.204 --> 02:04:49.924
MATT: Yeah, whatever your constitution saving
throw is.

02:04:49.924 --> 02:04:51.298
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm good.

02:04:51.298 --> 02:04:52.405
MATT: So maintains concentration.

02:04:52.405 --> 02:05:03.636
LAURA: And then for my bonus action, I'm going to cast--
oh, wait, can I do that? No, it's not. Shitballs.

02:05:03.636 --> 02:05:09.403
I was thinking I had a potion, but I don't, and I
can't cast a Cure Wounds. That's an action. And I

02:05:09.403 --> 02:05:18.073
can't retrograde a Hex on her. So I'm going to try
to hide again, because that's the only bonus I can

02:05:18.073 --> 02:05:19.388
do right now.

02:05:19.388 --> 02:05:21.899
MATT: You don't really have any way to hide from
her right now.

02:05:21.899 --> 02:05:24.007
LAURA: I'm going to drop down to the ground.

02:05:24.007 --> 02:05:25.520
MATT: Okay, so you drop prone.

02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:27.206
TRAVIS: Yeah, that's an angle you can hold.

02:05:27.206 --> 02:05:29.573
MATT: There you go, we'll say.

02:05:29.573 --> 02:05:32.775
LAURA: I don't have any movement. I used all my
movement just to get there.

02:05:32.775 --> 02:05:33.877
MATT: Yep.

02:05:33.877 --> 02:05:39.532
LAURA: Tight. Because there's no such thing as
Fire Storm, which just fucking destroyed me. No

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:41.030
such thing.

02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:43.059
MARISHA: Nope. Don't have any more of those.

02:05:43.059 --> 02:05:47.948
LAURA: Maybe I'll roll a natural 20 and then
she'll just not know that I dropped down. I rolled

02:05:47.948 --> 02:05:49.206
a natural 20!

02:05:49.206 --> 02:05:51.173
TRAVIS: Fucking right, she did.

02:05:51.173 --> 02:05:53.816
LAURA: Does it matter at all that I rolled a
natural 20?

02:05:53.816 --> 02:06:00.452
MATT: You watched her vanish. You know she's
somewhere on or near that roof, but you're not

02:06:00.452 --> 02:06:10.297
specifically aware. So that ends your turn. Grog?

02:06:10.297 --> 02:06:26.803
TRAVIS: Yeah. Can I step out of the room? Can I
use as my bonus action my Boots of Feral Leaping

02:06:26.803 --> 02:06:32.396
to jump 20 feet horizontally towards the building
that Vex is on? Straight line towards the door.

02:06:32.396 --> 02:06:33.808
Straight up.

02:06:33.808 --> 02:06:36.308
MATT: Roll for that.

02:06:36.308 --> 02:06:41.312
TRAVIS: That's a 22.

02:06:41.312 --> 02:06:49.999
MATT: 22, yep. You actually land on Doty's head,
crushing it into the ground.

02:06:49.999 --> 02:06:57.140
TRAVIS: Can I use the remainder of my 50 feet of
speed to run into the building that Vex is in?

02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:59.758
TALIESIN: He is being so smart.

02:06:59.758 --> 02:07:05.239
MATT: That's the rest of your movement, there.

02:07:05.239 --> 02:07:06.672
TRAVIS: Right there?

02:07:06.672 --> 02:07:11.867
MATT: Yeah. You can dash if you want to move all
the way in, but you won't have an action.

02:07:11.867 --> 02:07:15.407
SAM: You can still touch the building.

02:07:15.407 --> 02:07:26.671
TRAVIS: Damn, I thought that was going to be just
enough. I am going to dash inside.

02:07:26.671 --> 02:07:32.770
MATT: Okay. So you head inside, and you get to the
appearance of this.

02:07:32.770 --> 02:07:35.571
SAM: You're too big for the ceiling.

02:07:35.571 --> 02:07:40.014
MATT: You get in there, and there is the chest
there, yeah.

02:07:40.014 --> 02:07:42.722
TRAVIS: Great. That is my movement.

02:07:42.722 --> 02:07:44.158
MATT: That's your turn?

02:07:44.158 --> 02:07:45.105
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:07:45.105 --> 02:07:47.557
SAM: Did you drink the potion that you found? What
was it?

02:07:47.557 --> 02:07:49.501
TRAVIS: It was a greater.

02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:50.467
SAM: Oh, cool.

02:07:50.467 --> 02:07:52.178
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth?

02:07:52.178 --> 02:07:56.356
MARISHA: Oh god. I don't know what to do.

02:07:56.356 --> 02:08:01.388
MATT: Yeah, you just got shot twice, and you're
(gasps). You pull back inside and you're (gasps).

02:08:01.388 --> 02:08:06.294
You glance outside and you hear (heavy footfalls).
You have no idea where Vex is at the moment. The

02:08:06.294 --> 02:08:10.404
last you saw her, she was on the roof, and you
watched Grog dart by without seeing you and then

02:08:10.404 --> 02:08:12.223
run into the building right across the way.

02:08:12.223 --> 02:08:18.800
MARISHA: Okay. All right. Fucking hell.

02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:21.826
TALIESIN: I know. It's a horrifying piece of
paper.

02:08:21.826 --> 02:08:23.801
LAURA: I have to pee so bad.

02:08:23.801 --> 02:08:25.095
TRAVIS: Go now.

02:08:25.095 --> 02:08:26.628
LAURA: No, what if I die?

02:08:26.628 --> 02:08:28.676
MATT: What are you going to do, Keyleth?

02:08:28.676 --> 02:08:35.422
MARISHA: Okay. Fuck. Fuck! What am I going to do?

02:08:35.422 --> 02:08:38.835
MATT: What are you going to do?

02:08:38.835 --> 02:08:43.455
TALIESIN: Do something crazy.

02:08:43.455 --> 02:08:54.985
MARISHA: If I do a Fire Storm around there, can I
also call on the inside of the room, as well?

02:08:54.985 --> 02:08:59.355
MATT: Yeah. It's just making them adjacent to each
other. That can be in height, too, yeah. As long

02:08:59.355 --> 02:09:01.645
as they're against a surface.

02:09:01.645 --> 02:09:06.295
MARISHA: Yeah, fuck it. Let's do that again. Pop
out once again from the spire,

02:09:06.295 --> 02:09:09.023
(war cry) coming down.

02:09:09.023 --> 02:09:12.111
MATT: Okay. So how many points has that spent on
the spire?

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:16.954
MARISHA: I only did it once, so that's seven, so
that brings me to another seven, so I have six

02:09:16.954 --> 02:09:18.679
points left in the spire.

02:09:18.679 --> 02:09:27.202
MATT: There you go. You're causing it to consume
the entire roof?

02:09:27.202 --> 02:09:32.923
MARISHA: Yeah. And because I heard Grog run in
that area, too.

02:09:32.923 --> 02:09:36.345
MATT: Yeah, so you can just fill the roof and then
down the side and then fill the inside.

02:09:36.345 --> 02:09:38.451
MARISHA: I'm just lighting up that tower.

02:09:38.451 --> 02:09:40.978
MATT: All right, so I need both Grog and Vex to
make dexterity saving throws.

02:09:41.208 --> 02:09:47.062
TRAVIS: That might be all she wrote. We'll find
out. I have advantage on these. That's not

02:09:47.062 --> 02:09:48.880
awesome. That's better.

02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.786
LAURA: 25.

02:09:50.786 --> 02:09:51.927
TRAVIS: 19?

02:09:51.927 --> 02:09:58.202
MATT: 19 does not make it. So roll 7d10 fire
damage. You take half of it because you're

02:09:58.202 --> 02:09:59.302
resistant.

02:09:59.302 --> 02:10:01.584
LAURA: Well, that's good.

02:10:01.584 --> 02:10:07.797
TRAVIS: I've also been hit a lot. I don't like
getting that close.

02:10:07.797 --> 02:10:10.364
SAM: What just fell all over the floor?

02:10:10.364 --> 02:10:19.873
MARISHA: That was one of my dice. I re-roll ones.
Okay.

02:10:19.873 --> 02:10:21.843
LAURA: What did you just do?

02:10:21.843 --> 02:10:23.272
TRAVIS: Acted like I pushed you off.

02:10:23.272 --> 02:10:39.657
MARISHA: I rolled two tens, so that's 20. Two
eights, so that's 36. 41. 44. One, two, three,

02:10:39.657 --> 02:10:50.313
four, five, six, 44 plus seven is 51. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven. 7d10.

02:10:50.313 --> 02:10:54.687
MATT: Yep. 51 points of fire damage to you Grog,
halve that to 25.

02:10:54.687 --> 02:10:56.095
TRAVIS: 25.

02:10:56.095 --> 02:10:57.334
MATT: Still conscious?

02:10:57.334 --> 02:10:58.237
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:10:58.237 --> 02:11:01.437
MATT: Good. Vex, you take the same thing. 25
points of fire damage.

02:11:01.437 --> 02:11:03.277
LAURA: Okay.

02:11:03.277 --> 02:11:07.356
MATT: So that's your attack.

02:11:07.356 --> 02:11:13.098
MARISHA: For my bonus action, I want to bring my
Flaming Sphill to block this doorway that I'm in

02:11:13.098 --> 02:11:14.068
front of.

02:11:14.068 --> 02:11:15.246
MATT: The Flaming Sphere?

02:11:15.246 --> 02:11:16.082
MARISHA: Yep.

02:11:16.082 --> 02:11:20.082
LAURA: Sphill. The Flaming Sphill is what she
said, and that is what it forever will be called.

02:11:20.082 --> 02:11:22.862
MATT: The Flaming Sphere hits there.

02:11:22.862 --> 02:11:36.836
MARISHA: Okay, and then I want to move back and...
fuck. Around here, on the outside, and hide. Did

02:11:36.836 --> 02:11:41.038
you get where I said?

02:11:41.038 --> 02:11:45.300
MATT: Yeah, you're right. So yes.

02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:51.537
MARISHA: I want to go on this side of the building
to use for cover.

02:11:51.537 --> 02:11:54.184
MATT: So you get there.

02:11:54.184 --> 02:11:58.979
MARISHA: Perfect. And then I don't have anything
else I can do, do I?

02:11:58.979 --> 02:12:00.539
SAM: Well, you did everything.

02:12:00.539 --> 02:12:02.948
MARISHA: That's it.

02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:05.145
LAURA: Oh, I only called a giant Fire Storm!

02:12:05.145 --> 02:12:07.088
MARISHA: Can I also hide?

02:12:07.088 --> 02:12:11.077
MATT: No, you spent all your actions. They're well
aware of where you are; they watched you

02:12:11.077 --> 02:12:16.801
(footsteps) around the corner. You hear (heavy
breathing) around the wall.

02:12:16.801 --> 02:12:19.035
MARISHA: Fuck, I hope that wasn't a mistake.

02:12:19.035 --> 02:12:21.056
MATT: That finishes Keyleth's turn. Taryon.

02:12:21.056 --> 02:12:28.104
SAM: I assume, because you know me, Matt, and
you're a skilled strategery man, that I am

02:12:28.104 --> 02:12:29.641
somewhere near Doty?

02:12:29.641 --> 02:12:35.747
MATT: You could, with your movement, reach him.

02:12:35.747 --> 02:12:46.751
SAM: I'll hover near him, over him-- but not right
over him, everybody! And just chuck that Smoke

02:12:46.751 --> 02:12:48.674
Stick right on him.

02:12:48.674 --> 02:12:53.727
MATT: Okay. (hissing gas) What's the radius of
that?

02:12:53.727 --> 02:12:56.234
SAM: It's only a ten-foot radius.

02:12:56.234 --> 02:13:03.194
MATT: Yeah, so there's a 20-foot area here.
Keyleth's the only one that can see it out of the

02:13:03.194 --> 02:13:10.792
corner of your eye. You watch as where Doty's body
is, suddenly smoke fills this area here, obscuring

02:13:10.792 --> 02:13:15.434
Doty's currently not moving body. That's your
turn?

02:13:15.434 --> 02:13:16.895
SAM: That's it.

02:13:16.895 --> 02:13:18.748
TRAVIS: So wait, where did you go?

02:13:18.748 --> 02:13:26.816
SAM: I don't know, actually. I'm in the air,
somewhere within a 30-foot circle of Doty.

02:13:26.816 --> 02:13:27.997
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:13:27.997 --> 02:13:31.859
MATT: If this is going to continue, I want you to
tell me where you're going, just to come over and

02:13:31.859 --> 02:13:35.191
whisper to me. Otherwise this is getting a little
weird. For the first round, it's fine, but...

02:13:35.191 --> 02:13:36.666
TALIESIN: Start texting.

02:13:36.666 --> 02:13:42.135
MATT: Yeah, you can text me if you want to, or
come by and whisper real fast. All right. That

02:13:42.135 --> 02:13:44.720
brings us to top of the round...

02:13:44.720 --> 02:13:46.560
MARISHA: Is anyone still on fire, like Grog?

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:47.832
TRAVIS: Yeah, I am.

02:13:47.832 --> 02:13:49.090
MARISHA: Another ten.

02:13:49.090 --> 02:14:00.836
MATT: You did take ten damage, reduced to five.
All righty. So the towers (vibration) begin to

02:14:00.836 --> 02:14:05.925
extend that vibration again, and the gravity
begins to converge and condense around each of

02:14:05.925 --> 02:14:16.280
these towers once more. All righty. Vex, you're
up. You're on your back right now, going (groans).

02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:19.238
A little bit of smoke (coughs) out of the mouth.

02:14:19.238 --> 02:14:26.028
LAURA: If I flew up to the top of the tower,
nobody would see me that I know, right?

02:14:26.028 --> 02:14:27.250
Right now?

02:14:27.250 --> 02:14:28.672
MATT: That you know of.

02:14:28.672 --> 02:14:36.950
LAURA: Okay. Then I'm going to fly up to the top
of the tower by me. But I'm going to be at the

02:14:36.950 --> 02:14:40.389
back. I'm going to step away from the edge so that
people on the ground can't see me.

02:14:40.389 --> 02:14:41.939
MATT: Okay, about there.

02:14:41.939 --> 02:14:43.095
LAURA: Yeah.

02:14:43.095 --> 02:14:44.725
MATT: That's as far as you can get with your full
movement.

02:14:44.725 --> 02:14:54.407
LAURA: Okay, and I'm going to use my action to
cast Cure Wounds at 3rd level.

02:14:54.407 --> 02:14:55.932
MATT: Okay, go for it.

02:14:55.932 --> 02:15:15.801
LAURA: Which is 3d8. 15, plus my spellcasting
modifier, which is 18 points. So I heal 18 points

02:15:15.801 --> 02:15:19.938
of health.

02:15:19.938 --> 02:15:22.620
MATT: 18 points of health to you. All right, got
it.

02:15:22.744 --> 02:15:27.128
LAURA: And then I'm going to use my bonus action.

02:15:27.128 --> 02:15:33.446
MATT: Trinket's still doing okay. Succeeded two.

02:15:33.446 --> 02:15:42.632
LAURA: Oh, okay. I can't go down there. Before I
moved, can I have cast Hunter's Mark on Keyleth,

02:15:42.632 --> 02:15:44.236
for my bonus?

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:46.668
MATT: You didn't have visual on her at that time.

02:15:46.668 --> 02:15:49.658
LAURA: I still don't have visual? Do I have visual
on her now?

02:15:49.658 --> 02:15:53.686
MATT: Not since you moved away from the edge. You
moved out of the way to make sure

02:15:53.686 --> 02:15:54.859
nobody could see you.

02:15:54.859 --> 02:15:59.259
LAURA: Can I say I moved up, cast Hunter's Mark on
her, and then backed off?

02:15:59.259 --> 02:16:02.834
MATT: Sure, yeah. She wasn't hidden. So she's
marked.

02:16:02.834 --> 02:16:04.889
LAURA: Okay, and that's it.

02:16:04.889 --> 02:16:08.265
MATT: Okay, that's the end of your turn. Grog?

02:16:08.265 --> 02:16:13.160
TRAVIS: All right. Can I use my bonus action to
take the healing potion in that room?

02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:18.441
MATT: You haven't opened the chest yet. So your
action (bang) open the chest. Grab the potion,

02:16:18.441 --> 02:16:19.949
bonus action to drink it, yeah.

02:16:19.949 --> 02:16:21.033
TRAVIS: 4d4?

02:16:21.033 --> 02:16:22.013
MATT: 4d4 plus four.

02:16:22.013 --> 02:16:24.128
LAURA: The chest wasn't on fire and the potion
wasn't destroyed?

02:16:24.128 --> 02:16:29.063
MATT: The chest is burning, but you're already on
fire, so it doesn't affect you any more than it

02:16:29.063 --> 02:16:33.360
would. But you do take two points of fire damage.
It was four, reduced to two,

02:16:33.360 --> 02:16:34.837
because you're still burning.

02:16:34.837 --> 02:16:36.516
LAURA: (laughing) You're still burning.

02:16:36.516 --> 02:16:40.730
SAM: He's not wasting any actions to put himself
out?

02:16:40.730 --> 02:16:42.763
LAURA: No. I love it.

02:16:42.763 --> 02:16:44.187
MATT: It's very Grog.

02:16:44.187 --> 02:16:45.806
TRAVIS: 15.

02:16:45.806 --> 02:16:47.595
MARISHA: I know, I look fucking crazy.

02:16:47.595 --> 02:16:50.294
MATT: You were Hunter's Marked, by the way,
Keyleth.

02:16:50.294 --> 02:16:52.373
MARISHA: Fuck! Did I get hit?

02:16:52.373 --> 02:16:53.742
MATT: No, just Hunter's Marked.

02:16:53.742 --> 02:17:06.772
TRAVIS: Okay. And can I use my movement... to go
to this corner behind the wall?

02:17:06.772 --> 02:17:08.638
MATT: Yeah.

02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:11.598
LAURA: He is loving that fire.

02:17:11.598 --> 02:17:15.589
SAM: Oh shit! Does he see an empty ball sitting
there?

02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:16.889
MATT: Yep!

02:17:16.889 --> 02:17:18.650
SAM; The jig is up!

02:17:18.650 --> 02:17:22.688
MATT: You run over and you see a giant, empty
hamster ball with a big window carved in it that's

02:17:22.688 --> 02:17:24.492
empty and derelict.

02:17:24.492 --> 02:17:30.649
TRAVIS: Empty?! That's my turn.

02:17:30.649 --> 02:17:32.446
MATT: All righty. Keyleth.

02:17:32.446 --> 02:17:38.952
MARISHA: Okay. Oh my god. This is so scary.

02:17:38.952 --> 02:17:40.354
TALIESIN: You have that thing you can do.

02:17:40.354 --> 02:17:41.596
MARISHA: I do have that thing I can do.

02:17:41.596 --> 02:17:43.393
SAM: Oh, the Kill Everyone spell?

02:17:43.393 --> 02:17:48.044
MARISHA: Yeah, that Kill Everyone spell... It's
time.

02:17:48.044 --> 02:17:49.411
SAM: Oh god.

02:17:49.411 --> 02:17:50.483
MARISHA: It's time.

02:17:50.483 --> 02:17:52.855
TALIESIN: It's time. Yeah! I've been waiting for
it.

02:17:52.855 --> 02:18:01.742
MARISHA: I am going to, thinking of the acidy
black pit in front of us, and remembering

02:18:01.742 --> 02:18:13.454
Umbrasyl, I am going to turn into an adult black
dragon. (war cry) Full werewolf transformation.

02:18:13.454 --> 02:18:15.190
TRAVIS: Are you serious right now?

02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:19.202
MATT: So I don't have an adult black dragon mini.
We're going to use a red one,

02:18:19.202 --> 02:18:20.905
but you are a black one.

02:18:20.905 --> 02:18:24.851
MARISHA: And I burn my Shapechange.

02:18:24.851 --> 02:18:27.203
MATT: Yeah. You are still Hunter's Marked, but
yeah.

02:18:27.203 --> 02:18:29.821
MARISHA: I hope I don't die.

02:18:29.821 --> 02:18:33.962
SAM: No, we got this. We got this.

02:18:33.962 --> 02:18:36.272
TRAVIS: Do some shit!

02:18:36.272 --> 02:18:38.938
SAM: I don't exist.

02:18:38.938 --> 02:18:43.659
LAURA: Seriously! Just a bystander, this whole
fight.

02:18:43.659 --> 02:18:45.962
MARISHA: I can move, right?

02:18:45.962 --> 02:18:47.901
MATT: Yeah, you can still move.

02:18:47.901 --> 02:18:52.027
MARISHA: So how deep is this watery pit? Does it
go pretty deep?

02:18:52.027 --> 02:18:53.937
MATT: Only one way to find out.

02:18:53.937 --> 02:19:01.774
MARISHA: I am going to, as a dragon, see how far I
can get. I'm going to go black dragon, who can

02:19:01.774 --> 02:19:07.734
swim and is immune to acid. I'm going to go (heavy
footsteps) and see if I can lay underneath the

02:19:07.734 --> 02:19:09.585
surface of the acid.

02:19:09.585 --> 02:19:14.313
MATT: You delve into the pool with a splash as it
spills over the edges, and you submerge yourself

02:19:14.313 --> 02:19:18.603
beneath the surface. It's just deep enough for you
to get entirely within the water.

02:19:18.603 --> 02:19:22.151
LAURA: But all the acid pours up and out, doesn't
it? Displacement.

02:19:22.151 --> 02:19:26.725
MATT: It displaces a bit, yeah. But while she's in
it, she's currently submerged.

02:19:26.725 --> 02:19:28.037
TRAVIS: She's not hurt from it?

02:19:28.037 --> 02:19:33.312
LAURA: Does Trinket get hit by the acid? But Doty
does, too.

02:19:33.312 --> 02:19:37.004
MATT: Yep, both of them begin to just (sizzle).
Doty's done.

02:19:37.004 --> 02:19:39.584
LAURA: Right. But just in case.

02:19:39.584 --> 02:19:41.680
SAM: Oh. I thought he was immune, but he's not.

02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:47.789
MATT: Nope. And Trinket begins to slowly dissolve
in his unconscious state. That is a second failed

02:19:47.789 --> 02:19:49.466
death save on Trinket.

02:19:49.466 --> 02:19:50.815
SAM: Doty's done?

02:19:50.815 --> 02:19:52.626
MATT: Well, yeah.

02:19:52.626 --> 02:19:54.796
LAURA: Keyleth doesn't care about animals,
apparently.

02:19:54.796 --> 02:19:56.149
MARISHA: Nope.

02:19:56.149 --> 02:19:57.544
LAURA: Only plants.

02:19:57.544 --> 02:19:59.335
MARISHA: That's true. A little biased.

02:19:59.335 --> 02:20:04.131
TRAVIS: At least finish him with dignity before
you go into the pool. You just passed right by

02:20:04.131 --> 02:20:06.709
him. Just let him suffer, unconscious.

02:20:06.709 --> 02:20:11.784
MARISHA: I mean, I could accidentally trip over
him and kick him into the pool with me, if you

02:20:11.784 --> 02:20:13.080
really want me to.

02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:14.961
MATT: Is that your turn, Keyleth?

02:20:14.961 --> 02:20:15.794
MARISHA: That's it.

02:20:15.794 --> 02:20:16.974
MATT: All right. Taryon.

02:20:16.974 --> 02:20:18.380
SAM: Land in the smoke.

02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:19.475
MATT: All right.

02:20:19.475 --> 02:20:22.484
SAM: See that Doty is history.

02:20:22.484 --> 02:20:23.477
MATT: Yes.

02:20:23.477 --> 02:20:26.077
SAM: Fire Prismatic Spray at the dragon.

02:20:26.077 --> 02:20:28.322
MATT: Okay.

02:20:28.322 --> 02:20:29.580
MARISHA: You can't see me.

02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:39.348
MATT: You're submerged in the water, but the spray
goes through water. It's a light effect. So you

02:20:39.348 --> 02:20:44.522
grab one of your rubies, you run up to the edge of
the smoke, and release a Prismatic Spray in this

02:20:44.522 --> 02:20:55.257
direction. Trinket's done. Trinket is turned to
dust and ash. We're talking Terminator 2 dream

02:20:55.257 --> 02:20:56.735
sequence atomic bomb.

02:20:56.735 --> 02:20:58.098
TRAVIS: It's all T2 tonight!

02:20:58.098 --> 02:21:03.174
MARISHA: Question. Sorry, before we move too far.
Are people affected by my frightful presence

02:21:03.174 --> 02:21:10.456
within 120 feet? Those who are aware of me once I
(heavy footsteps) and then go in.

02:21:10.456 --> 02:21:12.426
MATT: That's an interesting point, actually.

02:21:12.426 --> 02:21:16.865
MARISHA: 120 feet, wisdom saving throw.

02:21:16.865 --> 02:21:22.477
MATT: Well, the only one who's seen you transform
is Taryon, so Taryon, I need you to go ahead and

02:21:22.477 --> 02:21:26.186
make a wisdom saving throw, please.

02:21:26.186 --> 02:21:36.233
SAM: Oh, that's not high for me. No, that's
terrible for me. Oh. I'm going to use Luck! I'm

02:21:36.233 --> 02:21:37.977
going to use Luck.

02:21:37.977 --> 02:21:40.531
TALIESIN: (cackles)

02:21:40.531 --> 02:21:42.162
TRAVIS: They're both terrible?

02:21:42.162 --> 02:21:43.525
SAM: One and a two.

02:21:43.525 --> 02:21:49.927
TALIESIN: A two and a one, even better. He rolled
a two. He rolled again and rolled a one.

02:21:49.927 --> 02:21:54.076
MATT: You are considered frightened. You watch as
Keyleth turns into this black dragon and you go

02:21:54.076 --> 02:21:57.669
(screams) and watch her dive into the acid pool
and you go (screams).

02:21:57.669 --> 02:22:01.224
SAM: So when I'm frightened, I just want to get
away, right?

02:22:01.224 --> 02:22:04.869
MATT: Well, no. When you're frightened,
specifically, you have disadvantage on ability

02:22:04.869 --> 02:22:09.821
checks and attack rolls, as long as you can see
them, and you cannot move willingly closer to it.

02:22:09.821 --> 02:22:17.535
You can move away or adjacent, but you cannot move
closer to her. You make the saving throw at the

02:22:17.535 --> 02:22:18.736
end of your turn.

02:22:18.736 --> 02:22:20.184
SAM: I was not planning on it, anyway.

02:22:20.184 --> 02:22:22.119
TALIESIN: But it does mean that you have
disadvantage on the attack.

02:22:22.119 --> 02:22:23.315
SAM: But it's a spell.

02:22:23.315 --> 02:22:25.867
MATT: It's a spell. It doesn't affect him at all.
So you still have to make a saving throw versus

02:22:25.867 --> 02:22:27.169
Prismatic Spray.

02:22:27.169 --> 02:22:29.360
MARISHA: Shit. What kind of a saving throw?

02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:30.739
MATT: We'll find out here in a second.

02:22:30.739 --> 02:22:35.674
TALIESIN: It could be anything. It could be
something you're downright immune to.

02:22:35.674 --> 02:22:37.628
MARISHA: That's true. Come on, acid!

02:22:37.628 --> 02:22:39.415
MATT: So I need you to roll a d8, please.

02:22:39.415 --> 02:22:44.613
SAM: d8. Four.

02:22:44.613 --> 02:22:52.878
MATT: Four. I need you to make a dexterity saving
throw as an adult black dragon.

02:22:52.878 --> 02:22:54.512
SAM: They're probably pretty dexterous.

02:22:54.512 --> 02:22:56.645
MARISHA: Well, they're big fatty dragons.

02:22:56.645 --> 02:22:58.795
TRAVIS: Wow, that is really stereotypical.

02:22:58.795 --> 02:23:04.133
MARISHA: Not great. Seven.

02:23:04.133 --> 02:23:07.739
MATT: Nope. So you take 10d6 poison damage.

02:23:07.739 --> 02:23:10.463
SAM: Poison! Poison for the win!

02:23:10.463 --> 02:23:12.859
MARISHA: Poison.

02:23:12.859 --> 02:23:18.725
SAM: I don't want to roll 10d6, so I'm going to
use one of those websites.

02:23:18.725 --> 02:23:23.277
TALIESIN: Here's 10d6. One, two, three...

02:23:23.277 --> 02:23:25.322
SAM: Then I have to do all the math.

02:23:25.322 --> 02:23:28.534
TALIESIN: Here's ten. Here's ten right here.

02:23:28.534 --> 02:23:30.091
TRAVIS: We've got calculators out, ready to help.

02:23:30.091 --> 02:23:31.427
MATT: You earned this.

02:23:31.427 --> 02:23:40.921
TALIESIN: All the ones that are not yours. Oh man.
Oh, that's bad.

02:23:40.921 --> 02:23:43.040
SAM: 34. That's not that bad.

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:44.199
MARISHA: 34?

02:23:44.199 --> 02:23:47.487
MATT: 34 points of poison damage to you. Make a
constitution saving throw.

02:23:47.487 --> 02:23:50.764
TRAVIS: How many hit points does an adult dragon
have?

02:23:50.764 --> 02:23:51.791
MARISHA: A lot.

02:23:51.791 --> 02:23:53.603
TRAVIS: Like, triple digits?

02:23:53.603 --> 02:23:55.927
MARISHA: Oh, that's a natural 19.

02:23:55.927 --> 02:23:58.048
MATT: You rolled twice, though, didn't you?

02:23:58.048 --> 02:23:59.238
MARISHA: I have advantage.

02:23:59.238 --> 02:24:04.652
MATT: Oh, that's right, because you have that
feat. She has the Warcaster feat. So you're good.

02:24:04.652 --> 02:24:06.753
TRAVIS: Why are we even in this fight?

02:24:06.753 --> 02:24:13.043
SAM: I'm no longer invisible. But I am in a
protecty cloud.

02:24:13.043 --> 02:24:20.181
MATT: You are. So Keyleth, while you're submerged
under the acid, all of a sudden there's a spray of

02:24:20.181 --> 02:24:25.316
greenish light that coasts through the surface of
the water and beams across you, and you feel a

02:24:25.316 --> 02:24:30.827
horrible poison take effect on your stomach and
internal system. You're like (groans). You saw it

02:24:30.827 --> 02:24:34.877
burst forth from that cloud of smoke that had been
appearing on that side of the battlefield just

02:24:34.877 --> 02:24:36.308
outside of the water.

02:24:36.308 --> 02:24:37.333
MARISHA: Okay.

02:24:37.333 --> 02:24:40.217
SAM: I used some movement to land. Do I have any
movement left?

02:24:40.217 --> 02:24:45.789
MATT: With your walking movement, yes. You still
have 40 feet left.

02:24:45.789 --> 02:24:47.316
SAM: Then I'd like to go...

02:24:47.316 --> 02:24:49.509
MATT: You are currently here.

02:24:49.509 --> 02:24:52.827
SAM: I'd like to go around to the back of this
wall back here. Yeah.

02:24:52.827 --> 02:24:54.416
MATT: Okay. There you go.

02:24:54.416 --> 02:24:56.334
SAM: And then I'll cast Sanctuary on myself.

02:24:56.334 --> 02:25:01.177
MATT: As a bonus action? Okay. Sanctuary on you.

02:25:01.177 --> 02:25:05.360
TRAVIS: God, really? Balls, wanker, ass.

02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:08.742
MATT: All righty. That ends Taryon's turn.

02:25:08.742 --> 02:25:13.577
SAM: I'm still in my sphere, everyone. Don't come
find me.

02:25:13.577 --> 02:25:15.709
LAURA: I heard Grog yell "empty."

02:25:15.709 --> 02:25:18.043
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did it loud.

02:25:18.043 --> 02:25:25.519
MATT: You did, just in time for all the braziers
to go (puff, fiery explosion). I need you to make

02:25:25.519 --> 02:25:27.748
a dexterity saving throw, Grog.

02:25:27.748 --> 02:25:37.412
TRAVIS: I was like, it's the other ones before
the braziers. Shit, ass, nipples. 15.

02:25:37.412 --> 02:25:41.139
MATT: 15? You take four points of fire damage,
reduced to two.

02:25:41.139 --> 02:25:42.505
TRAVIS: Hey!

02:25:42.505 --> 02:25:44.383
MATT: And you're set on fire, but you already
were.

02:25:44.383 --> 02:25:46.981
(laughter)

02:25:46.981 --> 02:25:51.822
MATT: All right. Vex, you're up.

02:25:51.822 --> 02:25:57.472
LAURA: I know where Grog is. I'm going to step
over and attack him.

02:25:57.472 --> 02:26:03.425
MATT: Okay, so you head over to the edge, glance
down, and you see the flames rescind from the

02:26:03.425 --> 02:26:08.238
brazier, and there Grog is patting the side of his
arm. The flames are on his shoulders, but he's

02:26:08.238 --> 02:26:09.926
putting it out on his elbow.

02:26:09.926 --> 02:26:11.490
TRAVIS: Sounds right.

02:26:11.490 --> 02:26:13.430
MATT: All right, go for it.

02:26:13.430 --> 02:26:16.466
LAURA: Oh yeah. 30?

02:26:16.466 --> 02:26:17.469
MATT: Yep.

02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:18.832
LAURA: Okay.

02:26:18.832 --> 02:26:25.277
TRAVIS: You're going to attack me over the giant
red dragon?

02:26:25.277 --> 02:26:26.989
MARISHA: I'm under the acid, man.

02:26:26.989 --> 02:26:30.841
LAURA: Yeah. 12 plus two lightning damage.

02:26:30.841 --> 02:26:36.414
TRAVIS: So six and one. Seven.

02:26:36.414 --> 02:26:43.582
LAURA: And then the second one definitely hits.

02:26:43.582 --> 02:26:45.916
MATT: Okay. This is getting close.

02:26:45.916 --> 02:26:51.704
LAURA: 16 plus one lightning damage.

02:26:51.704 --> 02:26:57.594
MATT: So eight, plus one. Nine. Nine damage.
Okay.

02:26:57.594 --> 02:27:05.604
LAURA: And for my bonus action, I'm going to-- oh
god. No.

02:27:05.604 --> 02:27:06.883
TRAVIS: Stay.

02:27:06.883 --> 02:27:11.596
LAURA: No, he can get up to me. I'm going to get
on my broom and I'm going to fly up! I'm going to

02:27:11.596 --> 02:27:13.975
fly into the air for my movement.

02:27:13.975 --> 02:27:20.080
MATT: You spent ten movement moving up to the side
there. You get on your broom, so you get up to

02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:30.274
about... we'll say, for the purposes of this, you
can't get too high up here. You get about there.

02:27:30.274 --> 02:27:36.743
LAURA: I don't want to fly up. I want to fly over.
I want to fly away from Grog. No, towards the

02:27:36.743 --> 02:27:38.086
other brazier. Yeah.

02:27:38.086 --> 02:27:40.655
MATT: You can get about there. A little bit over
to this side.

02:27:40.655 --> 02:27:43.215
LAURA: Okay, I'm going to do that.

02:27:43.215 --> 02:27:44.964
TRAVIS: About 15 feet up, you said?

02:27:44.964 --> 02:27:48.682
LAURA: Oh god! You know what? Ooh, this could be
real bad.

02:27:48.682 --> 02:27:50.635
MATT: That's what you're doing.

02:27:50.635 --> 02:27:56.795
LAURA: Nope. I'm not. I'm thinking about it. I'm
going to fly. I'm going to be up, but I'm going to

02:27:56.795 --> 02:28:01.225
stay over the roof. This is still stupid. I'm
going to die. Grog's going to kill me.

02:28:01.225 --> 02:28:04.936
MATT: We'll say you're up there.

02:28:04.936 --> 02:28:10.965
LAURA: But further over towards-- I want to hover
over the roof, but towards the other brazier.

02:28:10.965 --> 02:28:14.439
MATT: Right. About here. I'm just putting you--
fine, I'll move it.

02:28:14.439 --> 02:28:19.636
LAURA: Sorry. I got confused, Matt. I thought
that's where you were saying I was.

02:28:19.636 --> 02:28:21.772
MATT: There you go. Roughly, that's where you
are.

02:28:21.772 --> 02:28:22.832
LAURA: Okay.

02:28:22.832 --> 02:28:26.228
MATT: It's a lot to coordinate. That ends your
turn, Vex. Grog, you're up.

02:28:26.228 --> 02:28:34.431
TRAVIS: I was going to leave you alone. I was
going to leave you alone! Fucking dragon sitting

02:28:34.431 --> 02:28:42.778
in a big-ass pool of acid. Piece of shit! And then
the spiral's going to go off. Fuck it. I'm going

02:28:42.778 --> 02:28:48.604
to-- yeehaw howdy. Can I go to the rope ladder?
How much does that take,

02:28:48.604 --> 02:28:49.894
to get to the rope ladder?

02:28:49.894 --> 02:28:54.991
MATT: The wood ladder here? That is five, ten,
15.

02:28:54.991 --> 02:29:01.162
TRAVIS: 15. Can I use my Boots of Feral Leaping to
jump 15 feet vertically?

02:29:01.162 --> 02:29:03.196
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and roll.

02:29:03.196 --> 02:29:06.098
TRAVIS: That's all I need. 25.

02:29:06.098 --> 02:29:09.524
MATT: You get halfway up.

02:29:09.524 --> 02:29:12.595
TRAVIS: Can I use the rest of my movement
to climb up onto the turret

02:29:12.595 --> 02:29:14.336
and move to the far end?

02:29:14.336 --> 02:29:20.498
MATT: Yeah. You get up to right about there, and
you have ten more feet. This way? Okay.

02:29:20.498 --> 02:29:23.728
TRAVIS: Can I see Vex?

02:29:23.728 --> 02:29:25.402
MATT: Oh yeah.

02:29:25.402 --> 02:29:29.439
TRAVIS: (whoosh)

02:29:29.439 --> 02:29:32.158
LAURA: Hi, Grog.

02:29:32.158 --> 02:29:34.872
(laughter)

02:29:34.872 --> 02:29:36.057
TRAVIS: Reckless, please.

02:29:36.057 --> 02:29:37.205
MATT: Okay.

02:29:37.205 --> 02:29:40.757
TRAVIS: 25.

02:29:40.757 --> 02:29:43.262
LAURA: Oh, it hits me.

02:29:43.262 --> 02:29:45.754
TRAVIS: 19.

02:29:45.754 --> 02:29:46.840
LAURA: Doesn't.

02:29:46.840 --> 02:29:48.481
TRAVIS: No, that's the damage.

02:29:48.481 --> 02:29:49.700
LAURA: Oh. Shit.

02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:51.581
(laughter)

02:29:51.581 --> 02:30:00.299
TRAVIS: That's a million. That's 34 to hit.

02:30:00.299 --> 02:30:01.849
LAURA: Oh, 34 to hit.

02:30:01.849 --> 02:30:04.592
MATT: Grog, you took another four points of fire
damage, reduced to two, from the fire.

02:30:04.592 --> 02:30:10.529
TRAVIS: And the damage is 24.

02:30:10.529 --> 02:30:12.076
LAURA: Oh god.

02:30:12.076 --> 02:30:13.547
TRAVIS: Last one.

02:30:13.547 --> 02:30:14.985
LAURA: Oh dear lord.

02:30:14.985 --> 02:30:19.632
SAM: So the hammer keeps coming back, and he
throws it again? Oh, wow.

02:30:19.632 --> 02:30:23.638
MATT: (throwing noises) It's nasty.

02:30:23.638 --> 02:30:26.145
TRAVIS: That is a 25.

02:30:26.145 --> 02:30:30.083
LAURA: Oh no! I think my math is wrong. Hold on.

02:30:30.083 --> 02:30:31.648
TRAVIS: You did it right.

02:30:31.648 --> 02:30:39.763
LAURA: Hold on, that doesn't make sense. 25, you
say?

02:30:39.763 --> 02:30:41.449
TALIESIN: Points of damage.

02:30:41.449 --> 02:30:44.972
LAURA: Oh no, I just dropped unconscious.

02:30:44.972 --> 02:30:48.994
(laughter)

02:30:48.994 --> 02:30:51.696
LAURA: I stayed over the roof.

02:30:51.696 --> 02:30:58.199
MATT: You stayed over the roof. You fall prone.
You still take a point of bludgeoning damage,

02:30:58.266 --> 02:31:02.676
which is an immediate failed save, so you've lost
one death save and you're unconscious there.

02:31:02.676 --> 02:31:05.144
TRAVIS: And you're trapped up here with me.

02:31:05.144 --> 02:31:06.907
SAM: He'll go easy on you.

02:31:06.907 --> 02:31:14.425
LAURA: Yeah, I'm sure. Kill me quickly so I can go
pee, because I've had to for an hour now.

02:31:14.425 --> 02:31:16.281
MATT: That end your turn, Grog?

02:31:16.281 --> 02:31:17.498
TRAVIS: Yes, it does.

02:31:17.498 --> 02:31:27.429
MATT: All righty. Keyleth. You don't know where
anybody is. You're in acid water.

02:31:27.429 --> 02:31:33.551
MARISHA: I poke my head out. Do I see anything?

02:31:33.551 --> 02:31:34.999
MATT: Perception check.

02:31:34.999 --> 02:31:38.342
SAM: A bunch of smoke.

02:31:38.342 --> 02:31:42.258
MARISHA: Okay. 21.

02:31:42.258 --> 02:31:49.322
MATT: From this perspective? Not really. You do
see Vex go (thud).

02:31:49.322 --> 02:31:53.965
MARISHA: Cool. I've got a good idea. I'm going to
fly up.

02:31:53.965 --> 02:31:56.266
MATT: How far up are you going to fly?

02:31:56.266 --> 02:31:59.537
MARISHA: How high is the tower? (stutters)

02:31:59.537 --> 02:32:05.711
MATT: It's about 35 feet to the top. 35 feet to
the top edge.

02:32:05.711 --> 02:32:10.857
MARISHA: I've got a flying speed of 80 feet, so
I'm going to go 40 feet up.

02:32:10.857 --> 02:32:22.656
MATT: You see Vex unconscious on the ground there,
bleeding out of the side of the mouth, and you see

02:32:22.656 --> 02:32:24.031
a giant Grog.

02:32:24.031 --> 02:32:25.581
TALIESIN: On fire.

02:32:25.581 --> 02:32:30.911
MATT: On fire, with the hammer pulling back. Grog,
you look over your shoulder and you see a big

02:32:30.911 --> 02:32:32.511
black dragon (whoosh).

02:32:32.511 --> 02:32:37.444
MARISHA: I look at him and I say in Draconic,
because I always forget. I go, Grog, check it out!

02:32:37.444 --> 02:32:39.472
Grog, look!

02:32:39.472 --> 02:32:47.111
MATT: The dragon goes (guttural growling speech).

02:32:47.121 --> 02:32:53.648
MARISHA: I'm going to be like, sorry, but I've
always wanted to do this. (vomit noises) And do an

02:32:53.648 --> 02:32:58.335
acid breath. 60-foot line, five-foot wide.

02:32:58.335 --> 02:33:00.129
SAM: You're trashed.

02:33:00.129 --> 02:33:03.417
TRAVIS: Fire elemental, back to Keyleth, into a
dragon?

02:33:03.417 --> 02:33:04.730
LAURA: Come on.

02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:07.991
MATT: To be fair, you guys focused on each other
for most of this fight.

02:33:07.991 --> 02:33:10.036
TRAVIS: That's true.

02:33:10.036 --> 02:33:13.700
MATT: I need you to make a dexterity saving throw,
Grog.

02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:19.857
TRAVIS: Thank you. Thank you, sir. May I have
another? 17.

02:33:19.857 --> 02:33:24.597
MATT: That does not succeed. Keyleth, I need you
to roll your 12d8 acid damage

02:33:24.597 --> 02:33:26.591
that Grog's about to take.

02:33:26.591 --> 02:33:30.383
LAURA: Oh, are you immune to acid damage?

02:33:30.383 --> 02:33:31.539
TRAVIS: No.

02:33:31.539 --> 02:33:33.056
MATT: Nor resistant.

02:33:33.056 --> 02:33:42.430
MARISHA: I'll roll five and then I'll roll five
more. Actually, give me one more and I'll roll

02:33:42.430 --> 02:33:47.260
twice. Get that out of there.

02:33:47.260 --> 02:33:50.968
TALIESIN: And ones you reroll, right?

02:33:50.968 --> 02:33:52.353
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:33:52.353 --> 02:33:55.422
TALIESIN: (cackles)

02:33:55.422 --> 02:34:06.600
MARISHA: 16, plus let's do these two twos, which
is four, which brings us to 20, plus another 12,

02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:22.232
so that brings us to 32. And then I roll again.
32, plus another 14, which is going to be 46, plus

02:34:22.232 --> 02:34:36.919
three, which is 49, plus another six, which is 55,
plus another eight and another seven. 55 plus--

02:34:36.919 --> 02:34:38.374
TALIESIN: 70.

02:34:38.374 --> 02:34:40.366
MARISHA: 70, total. Acid damage.

02:34:40.366 --> 02:34:48.978
MATT: (guttural growling) There's a stream of acid
that sprays down the tower over you, Grog. Go

02:34:48.978 --> 02:34:53.813
ahead and make your constitution saving throw.

02:34:53.813 --> 02:34:58.227
SAM: Tary versus a dragon. This is Dragon Slayer.

02:34:58.227 --> 02:35:02.591
TRAVIS: 21.

02:35:02.591 --> 02:35:10.035
MATT: So as the acid sprays over Grog, Grog still
stands there, covered in acid and looks at you. It

02:35:10.035 --> 02:35:11.239
puts out the fire.

02:35:11.239 --> 02:35:14.621
MARISHA: Do you have one hit point left, or some
shit?

02:35:14.621 --> 02:35:18.973
MATT: Barbarians have an ability where when they
go to zero hit points, they make a constitution

02:35:18.973 --> 02:35:21.073
saving throw to resist going to zero.

02:35:21.073 --> 02:35:23.062
LAURA: What is he at, then?

02:35:23.062 --> 02:35:23.982
TRAVIS: One.

02:35:23.982 --> 02:35:25.106
LAURA: Oh, okay.

02:35:25.106 --> 02:35:27.589
MATT: But he's still standing as the acid is
(sizzling).

02:35:27.589 --> 02:35:28.664
TRAVIS: But the fire's out!

02:35:28.664 --> 02:35:32.995
MARISHA: The fire's out, which is ironic because
that means at the top of your turn you could have

02:35:32.995 --> 02:35:40.076
theoretically died. With the remainder of my
movement--

02:35:40.076 --> 02:35:45.203
MATT: Your Hunter's Mark is gone now. You have
your movement.

02:35:45.203 --> 02:35:51.905
MARISHA: I still have more movement. Can I go, oh
fuck! in Draconic and go (boop) right back

02:35:51.905 --> 02:35:53.202
underneath the acid?

02:35:53.202 --> 02:35:55.568
LAURA: She basically pooped. That's what it
sounded like she did.

02:35:55.568 --> 02:35:56.795
MATT: Okay.

02:35:56.795 --> 02:35:59.326
TRAVIS: How much movement do you have?

02:35:59.326 --> 02:36:00.957
MARISHA: I have an 80 fly speed.

02:36:00.957 --> 02:36:10.776
MATT: Into the water. You're mostly submerged
right now. Splashing in and out of the water, it's

02:36:10.776 --> 02:36:15.447
displacing a lot of the acid. Your wings and your
back are still visible.

02:36:15.447 --> 02:36:18.678
All right, that end your turn?

02:36:18.678 --> 02:36:24.090
MARISHA: He doesn't have anything fighting against
three-quarters cover.

02:36:24.090 --> 02:36:29.240
MATT: With that, Taryon.

02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:34.389
SAM: Yeah. I'll be fine.

02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:38.725
MATT: You watch this dragon fly up, spray acid
onto the tower,

02:36:38.725 --> 02:36:42.559
and then disappear into the water below.

02:36:42.559 --> 02:36:48.621
SAM: Out of curiosity, where and in what condition
is Percival's dead body?

02:36:48.621 --> 02:36:51.792
MATT: You haven't seen him.

02:36:51.792 --> 02:36:54.046
SAM: Great. Not even when I was in the sky?

02:36:54.046 --> 02:36:58.759
MATT: When you were in the sky, you saw what
looked like a mess in really nice clothing, so you

02:36:58.759 --> 02:37:01.896
saw Percival. The head was pumpkined. It was bad.

02:37:01.896 --> 02:37:03.217
SAM: Okay, then.

02:37:03.217 --> 02:37:09.167
TRAVIS: Are you checking on the state of Percy's
brain?

02:37:09.167 --> 02:37:16.302
SAM: I might need to use it. Can I poke out this
corner?

02:37:16.302 --> 02:37:20.605
TALIESIN: Is that getting closer to the dragon?

02:37:20.605 --> 02:37:23.161
SAM: Is it?

02:37:23.161 --> 02:37:31.689
MATT: Actually, here's the thing real fast. Let me
read this. Frightful presence. You repeat at the

02:37:31.689 --> 02:37:35.223
end of its turn. Make another roll for the end of
your last turn I forgot to make you do.

02:37:35.289 --> 02:37:37.641
SAM: That's a two again.

02:37:37.641 --> 02:37:43.516
MATT: So in theory, you know the dragon's there.
You can't quite move closer to it, and that would

02:37:43.516 --> 02:37:47.465
be considered closer, so you'd have to go around
this way.

02:37:47.465 --> 02:37:55.119
SAM: Where's the door to the thing? It's right
there on the front, right? The door to the tower?

02:37:55.119 --> 02:37:56.676
MATT: The door to the tower is right there, yeah.

02:37:56.676 --> 02:37:58.154
SAM: That's away from the dragon.

02:37:58.154 --> 02:37:59.316
MATT: It is, yeah.

02:37:59.316 --> 02:38:01.226
SAM: I'll use my movement to go there.

02:38:01.226 --> 02:38:02.519
MARISHA: Are you still invisible?

02:38:02.519 --> 02:38:03.423
SAM: Nope.

02:38:03.423 --> 02:38:07.417
MATT: You get there. You see the dragon as you
rush by. The smoke is still there.

02:38:07.417 --> 02:38:09.480
SAM: I poke around the side of the smoke.

02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.481
MARISHA: I'm like a Florida alligator right now.

02:38:12.481 --> 02:38:15.287
MATT: You move past the smoke and the pillar.

02:38:15.287 --> 02:38:18.640
SAM: And a quick little Prismatic Spray.

02:38:18.640 --> 02:38:28.210
MATT: This Flaming Sphere is gone, by the way.
Forgot that. All right, so roll a d8.

02:38:28.210 --> 02:38:32.352
TALIESIN: That's a d6.

02:38:32.352 --> 02:38:36.125
SAM: Oh shit. Four again. It's the same.

02:38:36.125 --> 02:38:37.174
MARISHA: Fuck!

02:38:37.174 --> 02:38:40.576
MATT: All right, so go ahead and roll a dexterity
saving throw, Keyleth.

02:38:40.576 --> 02:38:45.423
MARISHA: Nope. I think that's the exact same thing
I rolled last time.

02:38:45.423 --> 02:38:47.608
MATT: So that's another 10d6 poison damage.

02:38:47.608 --> 02:38:50.215
SAM: Should we call it the same?

02:38:50.215 --> 02:38:51.519
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

02:38:51.519 --> 02:38:55.519
SAM: I don't like to roll this many things!

02:38:55.519 --> 02:38:58.905
TRAVIS: You're actually very fast.

02:38:58.905 --> 02:39:08.158
TALIESIN: Two, four, six, eight, nine, and you
have one. There you go.

02:39:08.158 --> 02:39:15.058
SAM: 35.

02:39:15.058 --> 02:39:17.258
MATT: 35 points of fire damage to you.

02:39:17.258 --> 02:39:19.725
TALIESIN: 35 points of poison.

02:39:19.725 --> 02:39:21.036
MATT: Poison damage, yeah.

02:39:21.036 --> 02:39:25.705
TALIESIN: I'm enjoying being the rules Nazi here.

02:39:25.705 --> 02:39:30.977
MATT: Keyleth, make a constitution saving throw.

02:39:30.977 --> 02:39:39.526
MARISHA: Don't fuck me, Gil. Don't fuck me. That's
good. That's even better. 24.

02:39:39.526 --> 02:39:44.322
MATT: Yeah, you're fine. You maintain your
concentration. Okay, and?

02:39:44.322 --> 02:39:51.953
SAM: Going into the tower. I have a bunch of
movement left, right?

02:39:51.953 --> 02:39:53.262
MATT: You do, yeah.

02:39:53.262 --> 02:39:54.747
SAM: I'll go into the tower.

02:39:54.747 --> 02:39:59.805
MATT: You have your boots and the potion, so your
movement is 160?

02:39:59.805 --> 02:40:00.825
SAM: 120.

02:40:00.825 --> 02:40:05.823
MATT: 120. Yeah, you can go anywhere in that tower
if you wanted to. There's this floor, there's the

02:40:05.823 --> 02:40:08.066
second floor, there's a third floor, and then
there's the hatch through the top.

02:40:08.066 --> 02:40:09.844
SAM: Ooh, there's floors?

02:40:09.844 --> 02:40:10.810
MATT: Yeah.

02:40:10.810 --> 02:40:14.100
SAM: I'm going to go into the second floor, that
has those little...

02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:17.477
TRAVIS: Yeah, the little slit windows?

02:40:17.477 --> 02:40:20.093
SAM: Yeah. Is there any that can see the dragon,
or no?

02:40:20.093 --> 02:40:28.709
MATT: This is a stairway, which blocks this.
Technically, that's just there, so you can fit up

02:40:28.709 --> 02:40:34.789
into here, and you don't technically see the
dragon from that. You can glance over to the side

02:40:34.789 --> 02:40:38.921
of here and poke your head through the stairs and
look and be like (whimpers).

02:40:38.921 --> 02:40:45.998
SAM: I'll look, get a bead, and then just duck
back so no one knows where I am.

02:40:45.998 --> 02:40:48.029
And also Sanctuary.

02:40:48.029 --> 02:40:52.617
MATT: And also Sanctuary. One more. Sanctuary's
not there, since you used Prismatic Spray.

02:40:52.617 --> 02:40:54.700
LAURA: I know, right?

02:40:54.700 --> 02:40:56.138
MARISHA: Just hide.

02:40:56.138 --> 02:41:00.070
LAURA: I mean, come on, that would've been the
absolute best thing to do.

02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:02.119
TALIESIN: Just hide and be extremely inconvenient
to Matt.

02:41:02.119 --> 02:41:03.341
TRAVIS: It is a strategy.

02:41:03.341 --> 02:41:10.640
MARISHA: Yeah, you're called a dirty camper. A
camper! Like someone

02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:13.565
who camps in first-person shooters.

02:41:13.565 --> 02:41:16.016
SAM: That's me. That's exactly me.

02:41:16.016 --> 02:41:21.221
MATT: All righty, so make a wisdom saving throw to
see if you can resist the frightened effect.

02:41:21.221 --> 02:41:22.459
SAM: 15!

02:41:22.459 --> 02:41:23.421
MATT: Plus?

02:41:23.421 --> 02:41:24.544
SAM: Minus one.

02:41:24.544 --> 02:41:27.768
MATT: Minus one? Nope. You're still frightened.
You're still like, "Oh god, dragon!"

02:41:27.768 --> 02:41:31.119
LAURA: Damn, I wish my thing wasn't busted. I
would put him in the--

02:41:31.119 --> 02:41:32.101
TRAVIS: I know.

02:41:32.101 --> 02:41:41.125
MATT: All righty, top of the round. The pillars
once again (vibration) and begin to affect this

02:41:41.125 --> 02:41:47.315
area around these pillars, beginning to call
gravity to the ground. All righty. That brings us

02:41:47.315 --> 02:41:50.776
to... Vex, roll a death saving throw.

02:41:50.776 --> 02:41:54.464
LAURA: Save.

02:41:54.464 --> 02:42:00.233
MATT: Yeah, okay. Grog, your turn.

02:42:00.233 --> 02:42:09.237
TRAVIS: Standing there, with one hit point, acid
melting my flesh, I would like to pull out the

02:42:09.237 --> 02:42:10.918
Deck of Many Things.

02:42:10.918 --> 02:42:14.846
MARISHA: Oh, you dick! You dick!

02:42:14.917 --> 02:42:20.255
(laughter)

02:42:20.255 --> 02:42:22.562
LAURA: He has the actual, Matt!

02:42:22.562 --> 02:42:28.511
TRAVIS: I actually have this. It's blocked on the
back, and each card represents each one of them.

02:42:28.511 --> 02:42:30.148
You can check it, if it's good.

02:42:30.148 --> 02:42:33.522
MATT: Well, I'll have to pare down the deck, since
we don't have the full deck here. It's a half

02:42:33.522 --> 02:42:35.552
deck. Where did you get this?

02:42:35.552 --> 02:42:41.320
TRAVIS: I think that's... It was a gift from a
fan.

02:42:41.320 --> 02:42:44.076
MATT: Oh man. I'm going to do this.

02:42:44.076 --> 02:42:47.752
SAM: Thank you, Critters, for all the cool, useful
stuff.

02:42:47.752 --> 02:42:52.942
TRAVIS: I also have to name a number of cards that
I would like to pull.

02:42:52.942 --> 02:42:54.680
MATT: This is very true.

02:42:54.680 --> 02:43:00.255
TALIESIN: I'm so sad I'm dead right now. This
would've been worth everything.

02:43:00.255 --> 02:43:02.336
MATT: You may not be in a moment! Who knows?

02:43:02.336 --> 02:43:03.686
TALIESIN: Good god.

02:43:03.686 --> 02:43:08.195
MATT: Okay, so starting from here, we have...

02:43:08.195 --> 02:43:20.713
TALIESIN: I'm so proud of you. This is the end of
Cabin in the Woods. I'm so impressed. Lighting a

02:43:20.713 --> 02:43:23.001
cigarette at the end of the world.

02:43:23.001 --> 02:43:28.099
TRAVIS: There's not a ton that could help me, but
fuck it.

02:43:28.099 --> 02:43:35.138
MATT: Thanks for your patience, guys.

02:43:35.138 --> 02:43:37.559
TRAVIS: No, take your sweet time.

02:43:37.559 --> 02:43:41.451
SAM: What do we have in the store right now,
Laura?

02:43:41.451 --> 02:43:43.902
LAURA: Oh, we have t-shirts...

02:43:43.902 --> 02:43:45.538
SAM: What do they say on them?

02:43:45.538 --> 02:43:51.319
LAURA: We have Gilmore's Glorious Goods, we have
Vox Machina t-shirts, we have How Do You Want to

02:43:51.319 --> 02:43:52.768
Do This? t-shirts...

02:43:52.768 --> 02:43:58.350
SAM: I feel like people should go to the store and get
stuff now, because when the 100th episode runs

02:43:58.350 --> 02:44:03.263
around, some of those items might be dropped from
the store and replaced with new stuff.

02:44:03.263 --> 02:44:04.705
LAURA: You never know.

02:44:04.705 --> 02:44:07.337
SAM: I don't know, actually. I literally don't
know.

02:44:07.337 --> 02:44:09.391
TALIESIN: He literally has no idea.

02:44:09.391 --> 02:44:12.267
TRAVIS: It's not like we've been planning for a
100th episode or anything.

02:44:12.267 --> 02:44:13.418
LAURA: No.

02:44:13.418 --> 02:44:15.974
SAM: So if you want these items, you got to get
them now.

02:44:15.974 --> 02:44:18.926
TALIESIN: We should totally do that. We should
plan something.

02:44:18.926 --> 02:44:20.635
TRAVIS: We should. When is the 100th?

02:44:20.635 --> 02:44:28.974
LAURA: It's in a couple weeks, right? Is that
enough time to plan anything? Two weeks from now?

02:44:28.974 --> 02:44:31.423
We could throw something together, right?

02:44:31.423 --> 02:44:34.107
MARISHA: I'll get a cake from Porto's.

02:44:34.107 --> 02:44:36.700
SAM: That's it?

02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:40.817
MATT: So Grog. How many cards do you want to
pull?

02:44:40.817 --> 02:44:42.932
SAM: Five cards?!

02:44:42.932 --> 02:44:45.404
MATT: (giggling) Five? Five cards?

02:44:45.404 --> 02:44:49.181
TALIESIN: Yeah! Do it, I'm so proud of you!

02:44:49.232 --> 02:44:53.536
SAM: It's chaos, and you're not even going to be
here to deal with it! I'm in a house with this

02:44:53.536 --> 02:44:56.090
stuff! It's going to be me!

02:44:56.090 --> 02:45:00.709
MARISHA: Tary versus many horrible things.

02:45:00.709 --> 02:45:03.133
TALIESIN: No good, really bad day.

02:45:03.133 --> 02:45:09.956
LAURA: Oh my god, it's going to be a grim reaper
that comes out and kills Grog immediately.

02:45:09.956 --> 02:45:11.254
TRAVIS: Do you want to pick one for me?

02:45:11.254 --> 02:45:12.539
LAURA: Can I? Okay!

02:45:12.539 --> 02:45:15.491
TALIESIN: Oh my god. Choose the form of your
destroyer.

02:45:15.491 --> 02:45:18.242
TRAVIS: Wait, keep it face-down when you pick it.

02:45:18.242 --> 02:45:21.169
MATT: Okay. Five cards. Here, you guys got to
pick, all right.

02:45:21.169 --> 02:45:22.393
TRAVIS: Okay, I get four, you get one.

02:45:22.393 --> 02:45:23.584
LAURA: Okay!

02:45:23.584 --> 02:45:25.050
TRAVIS: One, two...

02:45:25.050 --> 02:45:33.738
MATT: Keep track of the order. The final one
there. Okay, so Vex is the last one.

02:45:33.738 --> 02:45:36.220
SAM: We're never going to get that far.

02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:37.820
TALIESIN: I'm so excited!

02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:44.576
MATT: Okay. Grog, first card. What did you pull?

02:45:44.576 --> 02:45:48.153
TRAVIS: Ruin.

02:45:48.153 --> 02:45:52.825
SAM: End of game.

02:45:52.825 --> 02:45:54.689
LAURA: What is Ruin?

02:45:54.689 --> 02:46:00.317
TRAVIS: The picture is a cliff exploding and a
body flying off to his death.

02:46:00.317 --> 02:46:03.532
SAM: That's literally what's about to happen.

02:46:03.532 --> 02:46:18.703
MATT: Grog. Weirdly, not much happens to you that
you notice in the moment. At all.

02:46:18.703 --> 02:46:21.395
TRAVIS: Great.

02:46:21.395 --> 02:46:23.892
TALIESIN: Oh, I know how Ruin works.

02:46:23.892 --> 02:46:30.785
MATT: Your Bag of Holding's fucking empty now, and
all of your non-magical items are gone.

02:46:30.785 --> 02:46:32.192
SAM: Oh, you're just poor.

02:46:32.192 --> 02:46:33.960
MATT: All of your personal wealth is gone.

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:39.035
MARISHA: What about his weapons and all of this
shit, too?

02:46:39.035 --> 02:46:47.052
MATT: Magical items are not affected. It's
non-magical. You're no longer a Grand Poobah in

02:46:47.052 --> 02:46:51.706
this temporary alternate universe. So that
probably was one of the better cards you could've

02:46:51.706 --> 02:46:55.414
pulled. What's the second card, Grog?

02:46:55.414 --> 02:46:56.902
TRAVIS: Rogue?

02:46:56.902 --> 02:46:58.283
MATT: Okay.

02:46:58.283 --> 02:47:01.277
LAURA: It looks terrible.

02:47:01.277 --> 02:47:06.914
TRAVIS: An individual standing in front of a devil
with five swords going through his torso.

02:47:06.914 --> 02:47:12.039
MATT: Okay, so no discernible effect at the
moment.

02:47:12.039 --> 02:47:13.409
MARISHA: What?

02:47:13.409 --> 02:47:15.352
LAURA: What does that one do?

02:47:15.352 --> 02:47:19.627
MATT: But I'll say for the hell of it: Should you
survive this battle, it's going to be really rough

02:47:19.627 --> 02:47:23.102
one day to have Wilhand stab you in your sleep.

02:47:23.102 --> 02:47:29.271
TRAVIS: Oh, it turns somebody against you? All
right. Third card.

02:47:29.271 --> 02:47:34.096
MATT: While you're sitting there, and you're
resting one night, Wilhand's like (growls).

02:47:34.096 --> 02:47:38.612
TRAVIS: If I survive this, and I'm acid-melted and
laying there dying, and he walks up with a little

02:47:38.612 --> 02:47:42.496
butter knife, I'll be like, do it! Just do it!

02:47:42.496 --> 02:47:44.505
MATT: All right. Third card.

02:47:44.505 --> 02:47:45.799
TRAVIS: Star.

02:47:45.799 --> 02:47:47.584
LAURA: Oh, it looks good. It looks like a good
one.

02:47:47.584 --> 02:47:50.020
TRAVIS: Which, it seems to be the opposite of
what's been happening, so maybe I'm fucked.

02:47:50.020 --> 02:47:52.303
MATT: Increase one of your ability scores by two.

02:47:52.303 --> 02:47:59.219
TRAVIS: Hey! Life score! Kill dragon score! Health
score?

02:47:59.219 --> 02:48:00.539
LAURA: Intelligence!

02:48:00.539 --> 02:48:02.783
MATT: You can increase your constitution by two.

02:48:02.783 --> 02:48:03.814
TRAVIS: Let's do that.

02:48:03.814 --> 02:48:06.338
MATT: Okay, so your hit points now go up by 17.

02:48:06.338 --> 02:48:07.395
TRAVIS: That's important.

02:48:07.395 --> 02:48:09.710
SAM: Does he have 18 hit points now?

02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:10.938
MATT: Yes, he does.

02:48:10.938 --> 02:48:11.697
MARISHA: Really?

02:48:11.697 --> 02:48:14.304
MATT: Yeah, because it automatically increases his
modifier by one.

02:48:14.304 --> 02:48:16.266
TRAVIS: I'm coming.

02:48:16.266 --> 02:48:17.832
MATT: All right.

02:48:17.832 --> 02:48:19.100
TRAVIS: We'll see.

02:48:19.100 --> 02:48:20.542
MATT: Fourth card?

02:48:20.542 --> 02:48:23.130
TRAVIS: Key.

02:48:23.130 --> 02:48:26.403
TALIESIN: Oh shit.

02:48:26.403 --> 02:48:27.675
MATT: Okay.

02:48:27.675 --> 02:48:31.312
LAURA: Is this a good one, too?
It looks good.

02:48:31.312 --> 02:48:34.454
MATT: This is the one I thought you had pulled
originally. A rare or rarer magical item.

02:48:34.559 --> 02:48:36.869
SAM: Oh, you get a cool thing!

02:48:36.869 --> 02:48:42.918
LAURA: I hope I've cursed him! Please let me have
cursed him!

02:48:42.918 --> 02:48:47.229
TRAVIS: I want the one that lets me succeed on my
next venture.

02:48:47.229 --> 02:48:49.791
MATT: I'm going to roll randomly for this real
fast.

02:48:49.791 --> 02:48:54.124
MARISHA: That one automatically succeeds at
something? Bring it, bitch.

02:48:54.124 --> 02:48:57.965
TALIESIN: This is amazing.

02:48:57.965 --> 02:49:01.528
TRAVIS: I should've just picked seven. I picked
five; that was good.

02:49:01.528 --> 02:49:04.050
LAURA: Five is a lot. Five is as high as you can
count.

02:49:04.050 --> 02:49:06.785
MARISHA: That's true. That's how many fingers you
have.

02:49:06.785 --> 02:49:08.289
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:49:08.289 --> 02:49:11.610
TALIESIN: That's the highest number you really
know. Everything is just more fives.

02:49:11.610 --> 02:49:16.689
MARISHA: Grog lives in intervals of fives.

02:49:16.689 --> 02:49:27.889
MATT: A beautiful black and ivory-inlaid sword
shows up, a greatsword shows up in your hand. You

02:49:27.889 --> 02:49:29.701
have to attune to it, unfortunately.

02:49:29.701 --> 02:49:32.939
TRAVIS: Right. I got 30 minutes to waste. Just
sitting here melting.

02:49:32.939 --> 02:49:37.595
MATT: And then, what's the next card?

02:49:37.595 --> 02:49:39.830
LAURA: Oh no, this looks good, too.

02:49:39.830 --> 02:49:42.177
TRAVIS: The Knight.

02:49:42.177 --> 02:49:44.665
MATT: (giggles)

02:49:44.665 --> 02:49:46.146
LAURA: Does he get a wish?

02:49:46.146 --> 02:49:50.102
MARISHA: Did he get something stupid? He's going
to the bag.

02:49:50.102 --> 02:49:52.491
SAM: You get a horse or something.

02:49:52.491 --> 02:49:56.170
MARISHA: Grog becomes cavalry.

02:49:56.170 --> 02:49:59.182
LAURA: Please be on top of the tower on a horse.

02:49:59.182 --> 02:50:03.185
MATT: You look at the card for a second like,
"Huh, what does this do?" And you hear a voice go

02:50:03.185 --> 02:50:07.201
(clears throat). You look to your side, and there
is a gentleman with armor and weapons who goes,

02:50:07.201 --> 02:50:15.523
"Sir Grog! I am here to serve you! Whatever you
need, let me know! My life for Strongjaw!"

02:50:15.523 --> 02:50:19.227
(laughter)

02:50:19.227 --> 02:50:22.246
TRAVIS: Do you have any health potions on you?

02:50:22.246 --> 02:50:26.533
MATT: "Oh, goodness, sir! Are you all right?"

02:50:26.533 --> 02:50:31.979
TRAVIS: Things are very bad. It's dire stakes.
Kill the dragon.

02:50:31.979 --> 02:50:33.279
MATT: "Dragon?"

02:50:33.279 --> 02:50:38.662
TRAVIS: Yeah, dragon. Your courage is most
important at this dire hour!

02:50:38.662 --> 02:50:40.858
MATT: Okay, you control this character. You tell
him whatever to do.

02:50:40.858 --> 02:50:43.602
So you have a 4th-level fighter.

02:50:43.602 --> 02:50:45.103
TRAVIS: 4th-level!

02:50:45.103 --> 02:50:48.338
MATT: Yeah. However, he's the same race as you, so
he's a goliath in full armor.

02:50:48.338 --> 02:50:51.893
TRAVIS: Hey! Sweet. Hold on, come here, I need to
draw some tattoos

02:50:51.893 --> 02:50:53.843
on you to make you look like me.

02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:57.484
MATT: All righty.

02:50:57.484 --> 02:50:59.795
TRAVIS: Awesome.

02:50:59.795 --> 02:51:02.367
SAM: The streak continues with Grog.

02:51:02.367 --> 02:51:09.704
TRAVIS: Right. Okay. I have 18 hit points.
Everybody's alive. That's my turn.

02:51:09.704 --> 02:51:11.038
LAURA: Can you move?

02:51:11.038 --> 02:51:12.823
TRAVIS: Were any of those draw again cards?

02:51:12.823 --> 02:51:13.957
MATT: Nope.

02:51:13.957 --> 02:51:15.080
TRAVIS: Yeah, cool.

02:51:15.080 --> 02:51:16.085
LAURA: Can you move?

02:51:16.085 --> 02:51:20.482
TRAVIS: Oh, I can move, because I'm alive. I live.
At this moment.

02:51:20.482 --> 02:51:22.127
MATT: Yeah.

02:51:22.127 --> 02:51:24.233
TRAVIS: I would like to go down the trapdoor.

02:51:24.233 --> 02:51:27.089
MATT: Okay. What about your friend?

02:51:27.089 --> 02:51:36.023
TRAVIS: Yes, with the friend. No! He's going to
stand up there. Just double birds. Out going like

02:51:36.023 --> 02:51:41.381
this. And he has to go, "I am Grog!" The whole
time.

02:51:41.381 --> 02:51:44.698
MATT: Okay, so you pull down the trap door once
again, and it's small in there.

02:51:44.698 --> 02:51:46.097
How far down do you go?

02:51:46.097 --> 02:51:47.702
TRAVIS: The second level.

02:51:47.702 --> 02:51:50.864
MATT: You go down to the second level and as you
crawl down, you look and you see Taryon there,

02:51:50.864 --> 02:51:58.612
looking out a window, looking very scared.

02:51:58.612 --> 02:52:00.015
SAM: Where's your skin?

02:52:00.015 --> 02:52:01.484
TRAVIS: (grunts)

02:52:01.484 --> 02:52:04.836
SAM: (shrieks) No! It bounces off my Sanctuary!

02:52:04.836 --> 02:52:13.361
MATT: You re-cast Sanctuary on yourself, right?

02:52:13.361 --> 02:52:14.742
SAM: Yeah, I did.

02:52:14.742 --> 02:52:16.879
MATT: All right, so that's your turn, Grog.

02:52:16.879 --> 02:52:17.911
TRAVIS: That's it.

02:52:17.911 --> 02:52:25.032
MATT: As your knight's double fingering towards
the... Gotcha. Whoa, this got weird. Okay.

02:52:25.032 --> 02:52:26.790
Keyleth, it's your turn.

02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:33.123
MARISHA: Okay, I'm going to come back out of the
acid. (war cry) What do I see? I look towards

02:52:33.123 --> 02:52:34.645
where Grog was.

02:52:34.645 --> 02:52:38.597
MATT: You look up and you see a goliath in full
armor just going...

02:52:38.597 --> 02:52:45.289
MARISHA: (war cry) I'm going to fly over, and I'm
going to land on top of the tower, and I'm going

02:52:45.289 --> 02:52:51.695
to do a multiattack against him. (heavy impacts)
And frightful presence. I don't know if that

02:52:51.695 --> 02:52:54.378
affects an imaginary knight from a deck of cards.

02:52:54.378 --> 02:52:58.431
MATT: It does! Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving
throw for the knight.

02:52:58.431 --> 02:53:02.944
LAURA: Is that a 20?

02:53:02.944 --> 02:53:04.788
TRAVIS: It's a three.

02:53:04.788 --> 02:53:11.701
MATT: Jeez. He's like, "Dragon! Where--" (screams)
As you land next to him,

02:53:11.701 --> 02:53:14.871
he's like (weak chuckle)

02:53:14.871 --> 02:53:20.932
TRAVIS: Poor bastard. Into creation for, what, 30
seconds?

02:53:20.932 --> 02:53:23.943
MATT: So full multiattack on this guy, you said,
right?

02:53:23.943 --> 02:53:25.613
MARISHA: Yep, bite and two claws.

02:53:25.613 --> 02:53:27.766
MATT: All right, go for it. Roll some attacks
here.

02:53:27.766 --> 02:53:31.768
MARISHA: That's a natural 19 on the first one.

02:53:31.768 --> 02:53:32.972
MATT: Okay, that'll hit.

02:53:32.972 --> 02:53:40.569
MARISHA: So that's 30. Not so good on the second
one. That's 15.

02:53:40.569 --> 02:53:42.599
MATT: Okay, 15 does not hit.

02:53:42.599 --> 02:53:52.064
MARISHA: Okay, and then on the third, that's a
seven plus 11, so 18.

02:53:52.064 --> 02:53:53.392
MATT: 18 does hit.

02:53:53.392 --> 02:53:54.481
MARISHA: So two attacks.

02:53:54.481 --> 02:53:55.863
MATT: Yep, two attacks hit.

02:53:55.863 --> 02:53:58.219
MARISHA: So one bite and one claw, I guess.

02:53:58.219 --> 02:54:00.223
MATT: Sure, go ahead and roll damage.

02:54:00.223 --> 02:54:19.411
MARISHA: 2d10 plus six, plus 1d8 for acid damage.
Oh man, why does this keep happening to me? Okay,

02:54:19.411 --> 02:54:32.769
11 plus seven is 18. Wait, let me make sure I'm
doing this right. No, plus six. 11 plus six, so

02:54:32.769 --> 02:54:45.569
17, and then 1d8. Four. Okay, so he takes 18--
wait, what did I just say? 17 piercing damage, and

02:54:45.569 --> 02:54:48.061
then four acid damage from the bite.

02:54:48.061 --> 02:54:51.384
MATT: Okay, so 21 total. And then your next
strike, the claw?

02:54:51.384 --> 02:55:00.672
MARISHA: Eight plus six is 12. 12 damage.

02:55:00.672 --> 02:55:05.638
MATT: 12 damage. As you strike him (heavy
impacts), he's like (whimpers)

02:55:05.638 --> 02:55:08.462
and he's still alive.

02:55:08.462 --> 02:55:13.672
MARISHA: Okay, can I take the rest of my movement
to fly and hover above?

02:55:13.672 --> 02:55:15.851
TRAVIS: Attack of opportunity.

02:55:15.851 --> 02:55:17.525
MATT: Yes, you do get an attack of opportunity.

02:55:17.525 --> 02:55:18.692
MARISHA: That's fine.

02:55:18.692 --> 02:55:23.673
MATT: All right, so you hover above, we'll say
with your full movement, you don't get too far,

02:55:23.673 --> 02:55:29.187
unfortunately, because you took, to get into that
space up there, would've been 70.

02:55:29.187 --> 02:55:33.518
MARISHA: Would I get out of the sphere of the
electrical attack? Then no, I'll just stay there.

02:55:33.518 --> 02:55:38.762
MATT: Okay. You stay there. Go ahead and roll an
attack for him.

02:55:38.762 --> 02:55:40.254
TRAVIS: What do you think?

02:55:40.254 --> 02:55:42.625
MARISHA: Does he get a retaliation attack?

02:55:42.625 --> 02:55:47.461
MATT: No, if you're not moving, he doesn't. You're
right. Never mind. All right, so bringing it back

02:55:47.461 --> 02:55:48.692
to Taryon.

02:55:48.692 --> 02:56:00.301
SAM: Never thought it would come to this. I hold
up a diamond, and I point it at your face, and I

02:56:00.301 --> 02:56:07.037
say, I will heal you if you swear you will not
stab me in the back.

02:56:07.037 --> 02:56:15.581
TRAVIS: I swear. I want this dragon dead.

02:56:15.581 --> 02:56:17.673
SAM: Insight check!

02:56:17.673 --> 02:56:19.981
MATT: All right, roll an insight check.

02:56:19.981 --> 02:56:25.232
SAM: That's pretty lousy. 11.

02:56:25.232 --> 02:56:32.878
TRAVIS: I swear. Yes. Giant dragon.

02:56:32.878 --> 02:56:37.409
SAM: Healing draught. 9d8.

02:56:37.409 --> 02:56:42.876
MATT: Go ahead. You have to drink it on your turn,
but he hands it to you.

02:56:42.876 --> 02:56:45.627
SAM: I can't use my action to pour it down his
throat?

02:56:45.627 --> 02:56:50.589
MATT: Yeah, you can. You walk up to Grog, and
(cork pop).

02:56:50.589 --> 02:56:51.782
TRAVIS: Give me these things.

02:56:51.782 --> 02:56:53.007
LAURA: What do you want?

02:56:53.007 --> 02:56:56.141
TRAVIS: 9d8! And who rolls them?

02:56:56.141 --> 02:56:58.726
TALIESIN: Here's another question, when was the
last time you hit something?

02:56:58.726 --> 02:57:01.636
TRAVIS: I have persistent rage.

02:57:01.636 --> 02:57:04.632
MATT: He can maintain his rage as long as he
wants. High-level barbarians, man.

02:57:04.632 --> 02:57:08.506
SAM: I will live... to regret this.

02:57:08.506 --> 02:57:10.958
TRAVIS: No! No.

02:57:10.958 --> 02:57:14.757
MATT: Well, there can be only one.

02:57:14.757 --> 02:57:26.812
TRAVIS: 46. 46 plus 18.

02:57:26.812 --> 02:57:29.142
SAM: That's pretty good.

02:57:29.142 --> 02:57:35.808
MATT: So 54? No, 64. 64 health, I think you're
at.

02:57:35.808 --> 02:57:38.192
TRAVIS: I'm at 64, yeah.

02:57:38.192 --> 02:57:40.964
MATT: That's your turn. You can move, Taryon, if
you want to, or do you want to stay put?

02:57:40.964 --> 02:57:48.966
SAM: I don't know what our plan of action is,
so... I can't go up, because I would be scared.

02:57:48.966 --> 02:57:50.968
Do I have to roll for fear again?

02:57:50.968 --> 02:57:53.920
MATT: Yes, at the end of your turn, you do. At the
end of your turn, though. If you're going to move,

02:57:53.920 --> 02:57:55.017
move first.

02:57:55.017 --> 02:57:57.783
SAM: I will move down to the bottom floor.

02:57:57.783 --> 02:58:00.244
MATT: Okay, you get down to the bottom floor, and
you're right by the doors, which are now burned

02:58:00.244 --> 02:58:04.565
down entirely. The wood has caught fire and
crumbled in.

02:58:04.565 --> 02:58:07.219
SAM: I still have some movement, right?

02:58:07.219 --> 02:58:09.083
MATT: Yeah, you have a shit-ton of movement.

02:58:09.083 --> 02:58:11.558
SAM: I look up to see if I can see the dragon.

02:58:11.558 --> 02:58:13.625
MATT: You see the edge of a wing going (whoosh).

02:58:13.625 --> 02:58:20.862
SAM: A wing. I'm going to go to the north bunker.

02:58:20.862 --> 02:58:30.142
MATT: Over here? Okay. With that, Taryon, you head
down through here and into this north bunker over

02:58:30.142 --> 02:58:36.577
here. All right. Grog, you're technically in that
room there.

02:58:36.577 --> 02:58:40.382
SAM: All right. And now I roll my fear?

02:58:40.382 --> 02:58:42.632
MATT: Yes, now you roll your fear.

02:58:42.632 --> 02:58:48.830
SAM: 16? 15. What do I have to roll to beat this
thing?

02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:50.504
MARISHA: Yeah, you didn't roll high enough.

02:58:50.504 --> 02:58:51.723
MATT: 18, I think it is?

02:58:51.723 --> 02:58:53.238
SAM: Jesus, I'm never going to do it.

02:58:53.238 --> 02:58:56.345
MATT: Only lasts a minute.

02:58:56.345 --> 02:58:57.746
SAM: Oh, okay.

02:58:57.746 --> 02:58:59.741
MATT: All right, that ends your turn, Taryon?

02:58:59.741 --> 02:59:00.973
SAM: Yep.

02:59:00.973 --> 02:59:10.974
MATT: The arcane towers (crackling) send out a
burst of energy. Roll a dexterity saving throw for

02:59:10.974 --> 02:59:13.825
your knight friend, and you roll, as well.

02:59:13.825 --> 02:59:15.133
LAURA: He's not dead?

02:59:15.133 --> 02:59:18.093
TRAVIS: No. 18?

02:59:18.093 --> 02:59:21.038
MARISHA: Oh, that's not that great. I thought that
was better. 15.

02:59:21.038 --> 02:59:23.467
MATT: 18? He succeeds.

02:59:23.467 --> 02:59:25.394
MARISHA: Goddamn it.

02:59:25.394 --> 02:59:35.044
MATT: It would be 16 lightning damage. Instead, he
takes eight. I'll mark that here. He's hurt pretty

02:59:35.044 --> 02:59:38.704
bad, but he's still hanging in there. What did you
roll?

02:59:38.704 --> 02:59:39.629
MARISHA: 15.

02:59:39.629 --> 02:59:45.839
MATT: 15. So you take 16 points of lightning
damage. Go ahead and roll a constitution check.

02:59:45.839 --> 02:59:48.023
MARISHA: A lot. I'm good.

02:59:48.023 --> 02:59:49.314
MATT: Okay.

02:59:49.314 --> 02:59:52.644
LAURA: That's a failed death save for me.

02:59:52.644 --> 02:59:57.646
MATT: And... yeah. How many have you lost now?

02:59:57.646 --> 03:00:00.578
LAURA: That's two fails.

03:00:00.578 --> 03:00:02.231
TRAVIS: What is the point?

03:00:02.231 --> 03:00:05.030
MATT: Now it's your turn. Go ahead and roll
again.

03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:11.148
LAURA: Well, all right. One!

03:00:11.148 --> 03:00:18.961
MATT: And with that, we'll say from a narrative
standpoint, as the lightning sparks out and it

03:00:18.961 --> 03:00:22.452
hits Keyleth in her dragon form, she falls back
and her back foot (squelch)

03:00:22.452 --> 03:00:27.111
accidentally smears Vex.

03:00:27.111 --> 03:00:31.244
TALIESIN: That's going to be hard to clean up.

03:00:31.244 --> 03:00:34.025
LAURA: No fate dice for us, Percy.

03:00:34.025 --> 03:00:40.547
MATT: All right, so that's the end of Vex's turn.
Grog, you're up.

03:00:40.547 --> 03:00:44.315
TRAVIS: I pull out the rest of the-- no, I run up
to the top of the tower.

03:00:44.315 --> 03:00:46.952
TALIESIN: Fear?

03:00:46.952 --> 03:00:50.892
MARISHA: He's immune to fear because barbarian and
raging.

03:00:50.892 --> 03:00:52.763
TRAVIS: I ain't scared.

03:00:52.763 --> 03:00:54.070
MARISHA: He ain't scared.

03:00:54.070 --> 03:01:03.275
TRAVIS: It's absurd. And then she has all of her
hit points left.

03:01:03.275 --> 03:01:09.401
MATT: So Grog, you get up to the top of the hatch
and you come out and you're right there next to

03:01:09.401 --> 03:01:12.681
your goliath friend, in the face of this big
dragon. What are you going to do?

03:01:12.681 --> 03:01:17.580
TRAVIS: I'm going to rush up to the giant red
dragon and go: Yo, Wilfred. This is how it's done,

03:01:17.580 --> 03:01:22.657
lad. And I do all three attacks, reckless, at the
fucking dragon.

03:01:22.657 --> 03:01:24.206
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

03:01:24.206 --> 03:01:26.944
SAM: Reckless? You could kill the dragon in one
move.

03:01:26.944 --> 03:01:29.964
TRAVIS: I don't think so. That's a 32?

03:01:29.964 --> 03:01:35.714
MARISHA: To hit? Yeah. He could take me down.

03:01:35.714 --> 03:01:37.614
TRAVIS: 24 on the first one.

03:01:37.614 --> 03:01:39.007
MARISHA: Damage?

03:01:39.007 --> 03:01:43.131
MATT: Before you roll damage on the next one, roll
another constitution saving throw for

03:01:43.131 --> 03:01:45.612
concentration. Beat a 12.

03:01:45.612 --> 03:01:46.472
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:01:46.472 --> 03:01:47.517
MATT: Okay.

03:01:47.517 --> 03:01:49.520
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:52.946
TALIESIN: You've had a few of those tonight.

03:01:52.946 --> 03:02:05.221
TRAVIS: Okay, so that was a nine, so 25. That was
nine on the die.

03:02:05.221 --> 03:02:11.866
MATT: You rolled a nine on the die. This is the
damage.

03:02:11.866 --> 03:02:13.838
MARISHA: Oh, right.

03:02:13.838 --> 03:02:17.409
MATT: So 18, plus your modifier.

03:02:17.409 --> 03:02:20.718
TRAVIS: So that's 34.

03:02:20.718 --> 03:02:23.470
MATT: Plus two additional dice for the weapon.

03:02:23.470 --> 03:02:33.305
TRAVIS: That's right, yeah. Ten, plus a three.
47.

03:02:33.305 --> 03:02:34.374
MARISHA: Total?

03:02:34.374 --> 03:02:39.971
MATT: 47 points of damage to you. Roll another
constitution saving throw. You have to beat a 23.

03:02:39.971 --> 03:02:48.110
MARISHA: As long as I roll over--

03:02:48.110 --> 03:02:49.310
MATT: Constitution.

03:02:49.310 --> 03:02:50.672
MARISHA: Oh, constitution?

03:02:50.672 --> 03:02:52.875
MATT: It's not wisdom. It's constitution for
these.

03:02:52.875 --> 03:02:54.940
LAURA: Have you been adding your wisdom modifier
this whole time?

03:02:54.940 --> 03:03:05.274
MARISHA: My constitution's all right. I've been
rolling over the minimum, anyway. No. Nope.

03:03:05.274 --> 03:03:07.444
MATT: Keyleth's form drops.

03:03:07.444 --> 03:03:09.262
SAM: Oh shit!

03:03:09.262 --> 03:03:21.124
MATT: The spell drops, losing concentration. Her
form reverts into regular Keyleth again. It wasn't

03:03:21.124 --> 03:03:25.352
damage over. There's Keyleth in front of you. You
still have your third attack.

03:03:25.352 --> 03:03:28.045
TRAVIS: I definitely think about kicking her off
the top of the tower.

03:03:28.045 --> 03:03:29.819
SAM: Of course you do.

03:03:29.819 --> 03:03:34.885
TRAVIS: I think the attack is better. Yep.
Reckless.

03:03:34.885 --> 03:03:37.877
SAM: So many menu options.

03:03:37.877 --> 03:03:43.503
TRAVIS: That hits. 33.

03:03:43.503 --> 03:03:45.451
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

03:03:45.451 --> 03:03:46.903
MARISHA: Why were you like, ugh?
You wanted a critical?

03:03:46.903 --> 03:03:50.657
TALIESIN: Don't be greedy.

03:03:50.657 --> 03:03:53.268
TRAVIS: I know. 27.

03:03:53.268 --> 03:03:54.938
MARISHA: Damage total?

03:03:54.938 --> 03:04:01.748
MATT: 27 damage to you, and your friend next to
you, who's no longer frightened because you're no

03:04:01.748 --> 03:04:03.169
longer a dragon.

03:04:03.169 --> 03:04:05.143
MARISHA: He doesn't get to attack, does he?

03:04:05.143 --> 03:04:10.825
MATT: Yeah, he does. He attacks on your turn. He
gets two attacks with his greatsword. Go ahead and

03:04:10.825 --> 03:04:13.012
attack twice for him. Plus five to hit.

03:04:13.012 --> 03:04:17.010
TRAVIS: Plus five to hit. That's a 23.

03:04:17.010 --> 03:04:18.180
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:21.699
TRAVIS: 24?

03:04:21.699 --> 03:04:25.070
MATT: All right, so 2d6 plus three to each hit.

03:04:25.070 --> 03:04:27.877
SAM: For the honor of Strongjaw!

03:04:27.877 --> 03:04:30.369
MATT: I'll protect you, my lord!

03:04:30.369 --> 03:04:33.289
TRAVIS: Ten, one. You said 2d6 plus one?

03:04:33.289 --> 03:04:34.598
MATT: 2d6 plus three.

03:04:34.598 --> 03:04:36.967
TRAVIS: Right, so that's 13 for the first one.

03:04:36.967 --> 03:04:38.278
MATT: 13 damage.

03:04:38.278 --> 03:04:42.203
TRAVIS: Six, seven. Ten.

03:04:42.203 --> 03:04:43.601
MARISHA: So 23 total.

03:04:43.601 --> 03:04:44.732
MATT and TRAVIS: 23 total.

03:04:44.732 --> 03:04:46.147
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:04:46.147 --> 03:04:52.819
TRAVIS: I thought he was going to be in and out in
a quick Pop Tart flash.

03:04:52.819 --> 03:04:54.780
MATT: Ends your turn, Grog?

03:04:54.780 --> 03:04:59.917
TRAVIS: Three attacks, bonus action. Can't do
anything. Yep.

03:04:59.917 --> 03:05:05.560
MATT: Keyleth, you're up. Form has dropped. Grog
is looking healthier than you remember him.

03:05:05.560 --> 03:05:15.494
MARISHA: Grog. We're friends, right? Remember me?
Come here. I'm going to grab him real quick and

03:05:15.494 --> 03:05:17.671
I'm going to do Plane Shift.

03:05:17.671 --> 03:05:21.972
TALIESIN: Whoa!

03:05:21.972 --> 03:05:23.857
MARISHA: It's me, Keyleth! (grunts)

03:05:23.857 --> 03:05:30.104
MATT: Roll a charisma saving throw. I think it's
charisma, right? Plane Shift is a charisma saving

03:05:30.104 --> 03:05:35.770
throw. Grog, roll a charisma saving throw.

03:05:35.770 --> 03:05:41.825
SAM: He's going to break this plane of existence,
too, and come back.

03:05:41.825 --> 03:05:44.763
TRAVIS: It's a 19.

03:05:44.763 --> 03:05:46.772
MATT: What's your charisma?

03:05:46.772 --> 03:05:48.267
TRAVIS: Plus one.

03:05:48.267 --> 03:05:49.473
MATT: So you rolled a 19?

03:05:49.473 --> 03:05:52.409
TRAVIS: It's a 20 with a plus one, but I need a
natural 20, I know.

03:05:52.409 --> 03:05:54.782
MATT: What did you roll on the dice?

03:05:54.782 --> 03:05:55.797
TRAVIS: 19.

03:05:55.797 --> 03:05:56.870
LAURA: Plus one.

03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:58.005
MATT: That's a 20.

03:05:58.005 --> 03:05:59.157
MARISHA: The 20 is what I had.

03:05:59.157 --> 03:06:00.172
MATT: Yeah, so he saves.

03:06:00.172 --> 03:06:02.511
MARISHA: You are lying to me. You are fucking
lying!

03:06:02.511 --> 03:06:03.883
MATT: It's what he rolled!

03:06:03.883 --> 03:06:06.985
TALIESIN: This is what's been happening all
night.

03:06:06.985 --> 03:06:14.115
SAM: The plane of existence. You break it!

03:06:14.115 --> 03:06:19.961
MATT: You resist the effect as Keyleth is holding
onto you, and she slowly lets go,

03:06:19.961 --> 03:06:21.308
shaking a little bit.

03:06:21.308 --> 03:06:23.603
TALIESIN: You have your bonus and your movement.

03:06:23.603 --> 03:06:24.946
MARISHA: I have a bonus and a movement.

03:06:24.946 --> 03:06:25.866
MATT: Yes, you do.

03:06:25.866 --> 03:06:28.310
MARISHA: Okay. Oh god.

03:06:28.310 --> 03:06:29.718
LAURA: Run away!

03:06:29.718 --> 03:06:32.973
MATT: That's your 7th-level spell, gone.

03:06:32.973 --> 03:06:35.720
LAURA: Plane Shift was her 7th-level spell?

03:06:35.720 --> 03:06:50.410
MARISHA: Yeah, it was bad. I'm still all right. I
have a bonus and a movement. Okay. I'm going to...

03:06:50.410 --> 03:06:59.966
take my bonus action to go oh, Grog! And cast a
Grasping Vine.

03:06:59.966 --> 03:07:02.566
MATT: Grasping Vine is 4th-level. You can't cast
it.

03:07:02.566 --> 03:07:15.625
MARISHA: Fuck! Okay. I will do... options are
dwindling very quickly.

03:07:15.625 --> 03:07:18.220
LAURA: Tary will be the survivor because he's
hiding.

03:07:18.220 --> 03:07:20.517
SAM: Why, because I haven't taken a single hit
yet?

03:07:20.517 --> 03:07:24.606
MARISHA: I have Freedom of Movement still on me,
though. Does that aid me escaping?

03:07:24.606 --> 03:07:29.030
MATT: Nope. Still gets a swing at you. Both of
them.

03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:42.138
MARISHA: Okay. I'm going to do a bonus action to
heal myself. Healing Word. Let's do a 3rd-level

03:07:42.138 --> 03:07:44.047
Healing Word.

03:07:44.047 --> 03:07:48.024
MATT: 2nd-level Healing Word. You can't do more
than 2nd-level.

03:07:48.024 --> 03:07:57.143
MARISHA: Sorry. You're right. 2nd-level Healing
Word. So it's 2d4. Oh my god.

03:07:57.143 --> 03:08:01.904
TALIESIN: You are the luckiest motherfucker. This
has all been just--

03:08:01.904 --> 03:08:04.976
LAURA: Why couldn't he have rolled like he did on
the one-shot, where

03:08:04.976 --> 03:08:07.068
it was one after one after one?

03:08:07.068 --> 03:08:10.190
MATT: I can't believe you made that fucking roll!

03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:16.969
TRAVIS: I was like, aw, it has to be a 20. Yeah.
My charisma's plus one.

03:08:16.969 --> 03:08:24.510
MATT: It's the hat. It's the feathered hat. It
pushes it just over.

03:08:24.510 --> 03:08:45.880
MARISHA: 53. Okay. And then I'm going to-- fucking
hell, I'm really tapped out. Okay, my mantle

03:08:45.880 --> 03:08:53.740
allows me to jump. My jump distance is tripled.
Does that mean I could successfully back up and

03:08:53.740 --> 03:08:57.365
jump off the tower and potentially land safely?

03:08:57.365 --> 03:08:59.317
MATT: Land safely?

03:08:59.317 --> 03:09:05.614
MARISHA: How about this? I'm going to go, sorry,
Grog! And turn and run, and I'm going to do a

03:09:05.614 --> 03:09:10.358
full-on ninja-style jump and see if I can land on
top of this roof?

03:09:10.358 --> 03:09:11.907
MATT: Okay.

03:09:11.907 --> 03:09:13.751
MARISHA: Parkour.

03:09:13.751 --> 03:09:16.875
MATT: Both you and your buddy get an attack of
opportunity on her.

03:09:16.875 --> 03:09:25.462
TRAVIS: Reckless, for me. Buddy, first. That's a
23 to hit.

03:09:25.462 --> 03:09:26.659
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:09:26.659 --> 03:09:28.117
MATT: 2d6 plus three.

03:09:28.117 --> 03:09:36.626
TRAVIS: Six.

03:09:36.626 --> 03:09:38.762
MATT: Six points of damage to you.

03:09:38.762 --> 03:09:50.001
MARISHA: Just six? Six from the knight. Okay, that
puts me at 46.

03:09:50.001 --> 03:09:52.116
TRAVIS: 28 to hit from me.

03:09:52.116 --> 03:09:54.076
SAM: That hits.

03:09:54.076 --> 03:10:00.298
TRAVIS: 21 points of damage.

03:10:00.298 --> 03:10:01.826
SAM: She's okay.

03:10:01.826 --> 03:10:05.674
MATT: Keyleth, you turn, you run. Make an
athletics check, please.

03:10:05.674 --> 03:10:09.212
MARISHA: Do I have advantage on this?

03:10:09.212 --> 03:10:10.639
MATT: No.

03:10:10.639 --> 03:10:15.825
MARISHA: I'm so bad at my athletics. I'm always
so bad! 12.

03:10:15.825 --> 03:10:19.615
MATT: It's okay. You didn't have to roll high.
You'll get a decent distance, but your jump

03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:24.402
distance is tripled because of your mantle, so you
do manage to make it and land on that roof. You

03:10:24.402 --> 03:10:32.676
take four points of bludgeoning damage. I rolled
one, one, two.

03:10:32.676 --> 03:10:34.825
MARISHA: Ugh, I fucking twisted my ankle.

03:10:34.825 --> 03:10:37.074
MATT: Yeah, it hurt. It pops a little bit, but
you're there.

03:10:37.074 --> 03:10:40.429
MARISHA: How much? Four points?

03:10:40.429 --> 03:10:54.167
MATT: Four points, yeah. All right. That's your
turn, Keyleth? Taryon. You're way over here.

03:10:54.167 --> 03:11:04.481
SAM: Fly out, fly up. Halfway up.

03:11:04.481 --> 03:11:06.986
MATT: Halfway up? About there.

03:11:06.986 --> 03:11:09.679
SAM: How does a cone work?

03:11:09.679 --> 03:11:12.429
MATT: Cone? It's a cone outward.

03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:18.924
SAM: We're dealing with three dimensions, here.

03:11:18.924 --> 03:11:22.378
MATT: You could hit both of them. All three of
them with it.

03:11:22.378 --> 03:11:24.477
SAM: I will aim that way.

03:11:24.477 --> 03:11:29.172
MATT: You have to pull back a lot, like over
here.

03:11:29.172 --> 03:11:31.266
MARISHA: What the fuck kind of cone are you
using?

03:11:31.266 --> 03:11:33.730
SAM: I have many Prismatic Sprays.

03:11:33.730 --> 03:11:37.519
MARISHA: Even though I'm down from them?

03:11:37.519 --> 03:11:44.679
SAM: It's a 60-feet distance, 60-foot cone. I
don't know if the math is going to work. If not, I

03:11:44.679 --> 03:11:46.416
have a backup plan.

03:11:46.416 --> 03:11:48.549
MATT: Yeah, they're all within 60 feet.

03:11:48.549 --> 03:11:50.092
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:11:50.092 --> 03:11:52.264
MARISHA: Tary wins.

03:11:52.264 --> 03:11:55.731
SAM: d8 again?

03:11:55.731 --> 03:11:59.127
MATT: Prismatic Spray. Yeah, d8.

03:11:59.127 --> 03:12:02.307
SAM: This is a different one. This is a five.

03:12:02.307 --> 03:12:15.710
MATT: Five. That's cold damage. I need Grog,
Keyleth. Your knight friend is (ice cracking)

03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:20.711
frozen into place and is now a frozen statue of
ice, there, up in the tower.

03:12:20.711 --> 03:12:21.974
MARISHA: Dexterity saves?

03:12:21.974 --> 03:12:24.179
MATT: Dexterity saving throw, yeah.

03:12:24.179 --> 03:12:25.999
MARISHA: Oh, that's good!

03:12:25.999 --> 03:12:30.624
TRAVIS: Six, but I have resistance to cold.

03:12:30.624 --> 03:12:34.723
MARISHA: I am at 20.

03:12:34.723 --> 03:12:39.341
MATT: Yeah, you succeed. So half damage to both of
you. Roll that now. It's 10d6 cold damage.

03:12:39.341 --> 03:12:41.664
TRAVIS: Ten cubes.

03:12:41.664 --> 03:12:49.296
MARISHA: That saving throw may be the only thing
that saves me. Maybe. Depends on how he rolls.

03:12:49.296 --> 03:12:52.983
MATT: Yeah, we'll see how the roll goes. This is
close.

03:12:53.158 --> 03:12:57.024
TALIESIN: Ooh. Oh. Yeah.

03:12:57.024 --> 03:13:05.268
SAM: 36, halved. 18.

03:13:05.268 --> 03:13:08.210
MARISHA: I'm good!

03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:11.493
TRAVIS: She says, before she dies.

03:13:11.493 --> 03:13:13.601
MARISHA: Shut your dirty mouth.

03:13:13.601 --> 03:13:27.059
SAM: Yeah. I'm flying. That negated my Sanctuary.
I'll do one more Sanctuary, and I'm going to stay

03:13:27.059 --> 03:13:32.915
up. Can I fly back down? That probably took all my
speed. Yeah, I'll hover in place.

03:13:32.915 --> 03:13:41.662
MATT: Top of the round. The towers surge,
bursting with energy up here and up here. Grog, I

03:13:41.662 --> 03:13:46.153
need you to roll another dexterity saving throw.

03:13:46.153 --> 03:13:47.856
TRAVIS: 18.

03:13:47.856 --> 03:13:52.255
MATT: 18? Okay, that just succeeds. You take half
damage.

03:13:52.255 --> 03:13:55.211
TRAVIS: And I have resistance.

03:13:55.211 --> 03:14:01.189
MATT: Right. I rolled pretty good, so it was 21
points of lightning damage, reduced to ten, and

03:14:01.189 --> 03:14:03.429
then halved because you have resistance, so five.

03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:04.856
TRAVIS: Okay.

03:14:04.856 --> 03:14:14.353
MATT: And Grog, it's your turn. You have Keyleth
over here.

03:14:14.353 --> 03:14:26.599
TRAVIS: Oh, I only have one target. I stride
confidently to the edge of the tower, and I'd like

03:14:26.599 --> 03:14:34.028
to use my Boots of Feral Leaping to jump and bring
my hammer down on top of Keyleth,

03:14:34.028 --> 03:14:36.256
on top of the tower.

03:14:36.256 --> 03:14:39.632
MATT: Go ahead and roll your athletics check.
Don't be a one.

03:14:39.632 --> 03:14:44.412
TRAVIS: Oh yeah, don't be a one. That's pretty
good. That's a 22.

03:14:44.412 --> 03:14:55.674
MATT: Okay. You leap and land. You do take three
points of bludgeoning damage.

03:14:55.674 --> 03:14:57.443
Six, reduced to three.

03:14:57.443 --> 03:15:01.811
MARISHA: Goddamn it, he was so close. I had him.
Twice!

03:15:01.811 --> 03:15:03.164
MATT: I know.

03:15:03.164 --> 03:15:05.416
MARISHA: I had you twice!

03:15:05.416 --> 03:15:08.404
TRAVIS: Reckless, I smash.

03:15:08.404 --> 03:15:10.306
MATT: Okay, go for it.

03:15:10.306 --> 03:15:15.013
MARISHA: Time for a beautiful and glorious death.

03:15:15.013 --> 03:15:17.928
LAURA: He got another 20!

03:15:17.928 --> 03:15:20.659
MATT: On the first hit? Go ahead and roll damage.

03:15:20.659 --> 03:15:23.882
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:15:23.882 --> 03:15:27.333
TRAVIS: That's a nine, so 18.

03:15:27.333 --> 03:15:29.572
MARISHA: I almost teleported his fucking ass.

03:15:29.572 --> 03:15:31.062
MATT: I know.

03:15:31.062 --> 03:15:33.611
TALIESIN: There's six places he should have died.

03:15:33.611 --> 03:15:35.360
TRAVIS: 34.

03:15:35.360 --> 03:15:37.065
MARISHA: I'm unconscious.

03:15:37.065 --> 03:15:45.598
TRAVIS: Let's not rush it. 43. 51.

03:15:45.598 --> 03:15:52.623
MATT: So Keyleth-- you take the three damage not
from the stone breaking your fall, but from her

03:15:52.693 --> 03:15:58.209
breaking your fall as you land on her. She (thud)
onto the stone, flat on the ground, the hammer

03:15:58.209 --> 03:16:02.215
placed squarely between the back of her
shoulderblades, in the middle of the neck. As you

03:16:02.215 --> 03:16:06.883
bring the hammer back up, pulling it back,
she's twitching a little on the stonework, but

03:16:06.883 --> 03:16:08.810
she's still alive.

03:16:08.810 --> 03:16:21.973
TRAVIS: I reach down. I grab one of those
jacked-up antlers, hold her up in the air. I look

03:16:21.973 --> 03:16:31.377
at Tary, and I lob it and smack her towards the
acid pool. I want to hit her in the air towards

03:16:31.377 --> 03:16:32.651
the acid pool.

03:16:32.651 --> 03:16:34.481
MATT: Roll an attack.

03:16:34.481 --> 03:16:38.004
MARISHA: (laughing) So cold!

03:16:38.004 --> 03:16:40.962
TRAVIS: Jesus. Yeah, 36?

03:16:40.962 --> 03:16:44.275
MATT: Yeah. It's an auto-crit, so it's two
automatic fails of your death saving throw.

03:16:44.275 --> 03:16:47.724
(splash) Make a strength check.

03:16:47.724 --> 03:16:49.056
MARISHA: Look.

03:16:49.056 --> 03:16:52.189
TALIESIN: Oh, that's depressing.

03:16:52.189 --> 03:16:53.480
MARISHA: Strength check.

03:16:53.480 --> 03:16:57.975
MATT: He's making it, not you. You're making it.
What did you get?

03:16:57.975 --> 03:17:00.699
TRAVIS: That is 12 plus eight. 20.

03:17:00.699 --> 03:17:09.289
MATT: 20. You arc her, (whoosh, sizzle) taking the
final death saving throw as you slowly dissolve in

03:17:09.289 --> 03:17:13.640
the acid. Keyleth eliminated from the battle.

03:17:13.640 --> 03:17:16.358
MARISHA: I got to use the tattoo.

03:17:16.358 --> 03:17:24.748
TRAVIS: One last attack. I look up at Tary and I'm
like, you did save me. What do you want to do?

03:17:24.748 --> 03:17:34.971
SAM: I crack my knuckles. Come on, little man.
Let's rumble.

03:17:34.971 --> 03:17:42.910
TRAVIS: I like your style. I have a throwing
distance. It is ranged, so I think it's at

03:17:42.910 --> 03:17:45.721
disadvantage, which is 70 feet.

03:17:45.721 --> 03:17:49.163
MATT: 70 feet? You can hit him at 70 feet, yeah.
It's disadvantage on the attack, though.

03:17:49.163 --> 03:17:50.923
TRAVIS: So a regular roll, reckless.

03:17:50.923 --> 03:17:54.739
MATT: Right. Well, first make a wisdom saving
throw, because he has Sanctuary.

03:17:54.739 --> 03:17:58.204
TRAVIS: That's right.

03:17:58.204 --> 03:18:00.813
LAURA: What did you get?

03:18:00.813 --> 03:18:02.151
TRAVIS: An eight.

03:18:02.151 --> 03:18:04.112
MATT: You go--

03:18:04.112 --> 03:18:15.931
TRAVIS: Nah. I'll let you go first. With my speed,
can I run on this side

03:18:15.931 --> 03:18:18.165
of the structure to get cover?

03:18:18.165 --> 03:18:19.501
MATT: Here?

03:18:19.501 --> 03:18:24.659
TRAVIS: Yep. Down. Whatever blocks his line of
sight from me.

03:18:24.659 --> 03:18:27.127
MATT: Okay. Your turn, Taryon.

03:18:27.127 --> 03:18:32.719
SAM: I'm flying, so I will fly where I saw him
hide.

03:18:32.719 --> 03:18:35.568
MATT: You see him. He's not really hiding.
(laughs)

03:18:35.568 --> 03:18:45.079
SAM: He's immune to everything, right?

03:18:45.079 --> 03:18:46.830
LAURA: No, he's just resistant.

03:18:46.830 --> 03:18:48.524
SAM: But he's resistant to everything.

03:18:48.524 --> 03:18:52.363
MATT: He's resistant to slashing, bludgeoning,
piercing, fire, cold, and lightning right now.

03:18:52.363 --> 03:18:55.381
LAURA: So poison, acid he's not resistant to.

03:18:55.381 --> 03:18:56.910
TRAVIS: I'm resistant to poison.

03:18:56.910 --> 03:18:58.567
LAURA: Oh, he's not resistant to acid.

03:18:58.567 --> 03:19:00.461
MATT: Yeah, because of your belt.

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:10.112
SAM: I'll fly over there and I guess I've got to
get within 30 feet above him. Or 30 feet of him.

03:19:10.112 --> 03:19:17.756
MATT: You can get about there. A little closer,
actually. You'd have to get to about there and you

03:19:17.756 --> 03:19:19.258
can throw to him.

03:19:19.258 --> 03:19:22.895
SAM: I'll chuck acid at him.

03:19:22.895 --> 03:19:31.165
MATT: This vial (splash) hits the ground and
splashes acid all around you. He has to make a

03:19:31.165 --> 03:19:32.827
dexterity saving throw, I think?

03:19:32.827 --> 03:19:34.448
SAM: I'll look.

03:19:34.448 --> 03:19:36.952
TRAVIS: Really? Already?

03:19:36.952 --> 03:19:41.800
SAM: Dexterity saving throw.

03:19:41.800 --> 03:19:47.681
TRAVIS: 18 is the first one. 18 on the second
one.

03:19:47.681 --> 03:19:50.339
MATT: The DC, I'm pretty sure 18 makes it.

03:19:50.339 --> 03:19:51.973
SAM: Yeah, so that's halved?

03:19:51.973 --> 03:19:56.335
TRAVIS: Danger sense.

03:19:56.335 --> 03:19:58.628
SAM: It's 9d6.

03:19:58.628 --> 03:20:02.141
TALIESIN: Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.

03:20:02.141 --> 03:20:10.825
MARISHA: If Tary wins, I'm going to be so happy,
even though dirty fucking camper. Dirty camper.

03:20:10.825 --> 03:20:12.527
MATT: No, that's a tactic.

03:20:12.527 --> 03:20:16.456
SAM: 16. Wow, lousy. It was all ones and twos.

03:20:16.456 --> 03:20:19.053
TRAVIS: 16 reduced to eight?

03:20:19.053 --> 03:20:21.558
MATT: You take eight points of acid damage, Grog.

03:20:21.558 --> 03:20:28.473
SAM: Oh, I attacked again, didn't I? Shit. I will
do another Sanctuary at level two.

03:20:28.473 --> 03:20:32.732
MATT: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

03:20:32.732 --> 03:20:39.395
SAM: (singing) I'm like a bird.

03:20:39.395 --> 03:20:51.659
TRAVIS: I climb back up on the roof. I walk over
to Tary. How did I break the Sanctuary with Groon?

03:20:51.659 --> 03:20:56.881
I just booped him, right? Can I reach him with my
fingertip?

03:20:56.881 --> 03:20:59.851
MATT: Nope. He's about 15 feet ahead of you.

03:20:59.851 --> 03:21:01.647
TRAVIS: I'm going to try and hit him.

03:21:01.647 --> 03:21:04.648
SAM: Jump and hit or throw and hit?

03:21:04.648 --> 03:21:06.192
TRAVIS: Throw and hit.

03:21:06.192 --> 03:21:08.103
MATT: So wisdom.

03:21:08.103 --> 03:21:10.029
TRAVIS: No. 13.

03:21:10.029 --> 03:21:12.176
MATT: So you go (frustrated noise).

03:21:12.176 --> 03:21:16.884
TRAVIS: Stubborn as a mule. 11.

03:21:16.884 --> 03:21:21.242
SAM: I'm doing that pec thing that you always do,
but I can't do it, so it looks like this.

03:21:21.242 --> 03:21:24.092
(laughter)

03:21:24.092 --> 03:21:30.325
TRAVIS: One more. Ooh! 19?

03:21:30.325 --> 03:21:37.667
SAM: Sure, yeah. That means it breaks my
Sanctuary, yeah. Does he roll again to attack?

03:21:37.667 --> 03:21:39.774
MATT: You have to roll to attack.

03:21:39.774 --> 03:21:46.150
TRAVIS: Reckless. I got through, ma! 31.

03:21:46.150 --> 03:21:47.319
SAM: Oh yeah.

03:21:47.319 --> 03:21:49.165
MATT: Roll damage on that.

03:21:49.165 --> 03:21:50.286
TRAVIS: 26.

03:21:50.286 --> 03:21:51.489
SAM: Okay.

03:21:51.489 --> 03:21:59.535
MATT: You're like, (laughs, gong sound). You taste
the blood for the

03:21:59.535 --> 03:22:01.813
first time in your mouth, really.

03:22:01.813 --> 03:22:03.535
TALIESIN: Does he stay on the broom?

03:22:03.535 --> 03:22:04.778
MATT: Yeah.

03:22:04.778 --> 03:22:06.331
LAURA: Had to bring him back, didn't you?

03:22:06.331 --> 03:22:08.521
MARISHA: This is your fault.

03:22:08.521 --> 03:22:10.133
SAM: Sorry.

03:22:10.133 --> 03:22:16.288
TRAVIS: With the rest of my movement, can I run
back down off the roof and into the room?

03:22:16.288 --> 03:22:30.029
MATT: Going off the roof there and then get
inside. So you'll be about there. You're low.

03:22:30.029 --> 03:22:36.219
You're hunched in there. Melee attacks inside that
room for you right now are going to be at

03:22:36.219 --> 03:22:41.207
disadvantage because the space is so crowded.
Taryon, your turn.

03:22:41.207 --> 03:22:57.232
SAM: I'm going to actually fly away further and
pull out another gem from my helmet and cast what

03:22:57.232 --> 03:23:12.549
modern-day people would call napalm. Straight into
the door. A Wall of Fire, straight in the door, in

03:23:12.549 --> 03:23:15.376
the room.

03:23:15.376 --> 03:23:21.010
TRAVIS: I ain't winning any beauty contests.

03:23:21.010 --> 03:23:24.129
MATT: A straight wall of flame engulfs the room.

03:23:24.129 --> 03:23:26.524
TRAVIS: (screams)

03:23:26.524 --> 03:23:30.313
SAM: It's 5d8 fire damage.

03:23:30.313 --> 03:23:34.444
TRAVIS: Ones and twos. Here we go!

03:23:34.444 --> 03:23:37.076
SAM: But you're resistant, right?

03:23:37.076 --> 03:23:37.784
TRAVIS: Yeah.

03:23:37.784 --> 03:23:39.083
SAM: Okay.

03:23:39.083 --> 03:23:44.199
TRAVIS: I've been burned, melted, burned, melted,
and burned.

03:23:44.199 --> 03:23:51.289
MATT: Dexterity save from you, Grog.

03:23:51.289 --> 03:24:01.416
TRAVIS: Dexterity? 21. Plus two on a 19.

03:24:01.416 --> 03:24:03.074
SAM: 26.

03:24:03.074 --> 03:24:08.408
MATT: 26, so you take half that, which is 13,
because you succeeded on your save, and then half

03:24:08.408 --> 03:24:12.566
that. You take six points of fire damage.

03:24:12.566 --> 03:24:14.304
SAM: That's it? Weak.

03:24:14.304 --> 03:24:16.323
MATT: He's resistant to fire, man.

03:24:16.323 --> 03:24:18.418
SAM: Okay.

03:24:18.418 --> 03:24:24.852
MATT: That's your turn? You still have your bonus
action.

03:24:24.852 --> 03:24:28.194
SAM: I'll Sanctuary myself again.

03:24:28.194 --> 03:24:30.734
MATT: (laughs) All right.

03:24:30.734 --> 03:24:39.826
TRAVIS: Damn it. Sanctuary!

03:24:39.826 --> 03:24:41.478
MATT: Grog, it's your turn.

03:24:41.478 --> 03:24:44.276
TRAVIS: How far above the roof of that building is
he?

03:24:44.276 --> 03:24:46.300
MATT: He's 30 feet above it.

03:24:46.300 --> 03:24:51.197
TRAVIS: Okay, never mind. I will leap horizontally
towards the building that

03:24:51.197 --> 03:24:53.350
he is close to. 20 feet.

03:24:53.350 --> 03:24:56.625
MATT: You have to move out of the room first. So
you have ten feet out.

03:24:56.625 --> 03:25:06.711
TRAVIS: I might not have made that. 17. I made it
by one.

03:25:06.711 --> 03:25:10.899
MARISHA: Oh, you almost tripped in the acid? That
would have been awesome.

03:25:10.899 --> 03:25:12.346
MATT: That would have been great.

03:25:12.346 --> 03:25:13.893
TRAVIS: Yeah, because I fall prone.

03:25:13.893 --> 03:25:16.599
MARISHA: Damn. It would have been so cool.

03:25:16.599 --> 03:25:23.353
TRAVIS: So 20 feet horizontally, and then the rest
of my speed to run to the building, climb up on

03:25:23.353 --> 03:25:30.375
the roof, and get right underneath him. I'd like
to try and get through this fucking Sanctuary.

03:25:30.375 --> 03:25:31.562
MATT: Wisdom save.

03:25:31.562 --> 03:25:33.327
LAURA: I like that we thought this might go fast.

03:25:33.327 --> 03:25:36.489
MARISHA: I know. I'm still laughing at him saying
that at the top.

03:25:36.489 --> 03:25:38.916
TRAVIS: 14.

03:25:38.916 --> 03:25:40.635
MATT: Second attack lost.

03:25:40.635 --> 03:25:43.493
TRAVIS: 19.

03:25:43.493 --> 03:25:44.904
SAM: Oh yeah. That gets through.

03:25:44.904 --> 03:25:50.083
MATT: Third and final strike. (grunts)

03:25:50.083 --> 03:25:53.674
TRAVIS: 31.

03:25:53.674 --> 03:25:55.523
MATT: 31 points of damage.

03:25:55.523 --> 03:25:57.329
TRAVIS: No, just to hit.

03:25:57.329 --> 03:25:58.697
MATT: Oh, to hit? Okay.

03:25:58.697 --> 03:26:01.661
TRAVIS: Ten, 26.

03:26:01.661 --> 03:26:03.086
MATT: 26 points of damage.

03:26:03.086 --> 03:26:04.824
SAM: Okay. Still kicking.

03:26:04.824 --> 03:26:07.458
TALIESIN: Quite well, I might add.

03:26:07.458 --> 03:26:10.049
LAURA: He's got a lot. He had a lot of hit
points.

03:26:10.049 --> 03:26:10.828
TRAVIS: Who?

03:26:10.828 --> 03:26:11.608
LAURA: Tary.

03:26:11.608 --> 03:26:15.168
TRAVIS: Oh, really? He ate half of his cloak or
whatever.

03:26:15.168 --> 03:26:17.095
SAM: This guy is impossible to kill.

03:26:17.095 --> 03:26:21.365
LAURA: Not impossible, Tary. It's not impossible.

03:26:21.365 --> 03:26:23.092
MATT: All right. Tary, it's your turn.

03:26:23.092 --> 03:26:30.586
SAM: Yeah.

03:26:30.586 --> 03:26:37.812
MARISHA: 19. That 19 will haunt me for forever.

03:26:37.812 --> 03:26:53.776
SAM: Is pulling a patch an action? I'll fly right
over the acid pit, right over the center, and I've

03:26:53.776 --> 03:26:56.595
got to do one more Prismatic Spray.

03:26:56.595 --> 03:27:00.727
MATT: All righty. Dexterity check, Grog. Roll a
d8.

03:27:00.727 --> 03:27:02.592
TRAVIS: A d8?

03:27:02.592 --> 03:27:04.613
MATT: He rolls a d8. What did you roll?

03:27:04.613 --> 03:27:07.308
TRAVIS: 19?

03:27:07.308 --> 03:27:10.781
SAM: It's four. It's poison, right?

03:27:10.781 --> 03:27:12.173
MATT: Four is poison, yeah.

03:27:12.173 --> 03:27:13.914
TRAVIS: Which I have resistance to.

03:27:13.914 --> 03:27:17.745
MATT: Yeah, so roll 10d6. And he saved, so he
takes a quarter of the poison damage.

03:27:17.745 --> 03:27:22.961
SAM: Wait, a quarter?! Goddamn it! This guy!

03:27:22.961 --> 03:27:29.982
TRAVIS: Tary, at any time, you can just plop into
the acid and it will all be over. You can drop in,

03:27:29.982 --> 03:27:41.238
listen to the bubbles consume your flesh. Be like
soggy Cracklin' Oat Bran. That milk looks weird.

03:27:41.238 --> 03:27:45.670
SAM: 42 halved and quartered. So it's 11? Wait, is
that right?

03:27:45.670 --> 03:27:46.963
TRAVIS: 21.

03:27:46.963 --> 03:27:49.698
MATT: 21, ten. Ten points of poison damage.

03:27:49.698 --> 03:27:51.740
SAM: Ten? Ten?!

03:27:51.740 --> 03:27:54.734
MATT: He can't have that much more. Don't give
up.

03:27:54.734 --> 03:27:56.944
TRAVIS: Let me guess. Sanctuary?

03:27:56.944 --> 03:28:00.355
SAM: Oh yeah. That's a good idea!

03:28:00.355 --> 03:28:02.189
(laughter)

03:28:02.189 --> 03:28:03.979
SAM: I don't have many more of those.

03:28:03.979 --> 03:28:06.306
MATT: All righty. Grog, it's your turn.

03:28:06.306 --> 03:28:07.954
SAM: 3rd-level Sanctuary.

03:28:07.954 --> 03:28:13.160
TRAVIS: I fucking walk off the roof and toward the
edge of the acid and I'm like, okay,

03:28:13.160 --> 03:28:14.889
in range, and I'll--

03:28:14.889 --> 03:28:18.883
LAURA: Wait, you can't cast 3rd-level spells after
you've already done a spell. You can only do

03:28:18.883 --> 03:28:20.132
2nd-level.

03:28:20.132 --> 03:28:23.158
SAM: Is the Prismatic Spray a spell?

03:28:23.158 --> 03:28:27.373
MATT: It's not casting it at a higher level. He's
sacrificing a higher-level spell slot to cast a

03:28:27.373 --> 03:28:29.580
lower-level. It doesn't change anything about it.

03:28:29.580 --> 03:28:36.430
SAM: No, but because I used Prismatic Spray. Oh, I
see. It's still a low-level spell. I'm just using

03:28:36.430 --> 03:28:37.414
a slot.

03:28:37.414 --> 03:28:40.030
MATT: You're just using a higher-level slot. It's
not casting at a higher level.

03:28:40.030 --> 03:28:45.037
MARISHA: Wait, what? All right. I just thought if
you cast it as a higher-level spell, you couldn't

03:28:45.037 --> 03:28:46.859
do it as a lower-level spell?

03:28:46.859 --> 03:28:48.407
SAM: Shenanigans.

03:28:48.407 --> 03:28:52.681
MATT: He's basically sacrificing a high-level
spell to cast a lower-level spell that doesn't get

03:28:52.681 --> 03:28:54.454
any benefit from being sacrificed.

03:28:54.454 --> 03:29:00.998
TRAVIS: First wisdom save. Goddamn, the fucking--
17?

03:29:00.998 --> 03:29:02.722
SAM: That's my DC.

03:29:02.722 --> 03:29:04.589
MATT: First attack, you get through.

03:29:04.589 --> 03:29:07.346
SAM: Where are you?

03:29:07.346 --> 03:29:08.955
MATT: He moved right under here.

03:29:08.955 --> 03:29:10.597
TALIESIN: He's right under you.

03:29:10.597 --> 03:29:11.932
SAM: But I'm over the acid!

03:29:11.932 --> 03:29:14.953
MARISHA: If you land in the acid, dude--

03:29:14.953 --> 03:29:17.084
LAURA: If he knocks you off your broom?

03:29:17.084 --> 03:29:19.612
TRAVIS: It's a 37 to hit.

03:29:19.612 --> 03:29:24.060
LAURA: Did he get knocked off his broom? He
doesn't have the same things that I have.

03:29:24.132 --> 03:29:28.343
TRAVIS: 24 on the first hit, for damage.

03:29:28.343 --> 03:29:32.789
TALIESIN: I don't think we ever built a safety net
into his broom.

03:29:32.789 --> 03:29:37.657
MATT: No, but he's not being knocked-- if it was
an attack that pushed or did anything to affect

03:29:37.657 --> 03:29:41.111
his movement or yank him, then it would become an
issue. Just doing damage won't do anything.

03:29:41.111 --> 03:29:46.663
TRAVIS: Oh, 26?

03:29:46.663 --> 03:29:49.540
MATT: The same things that would knock him off the
broom would knock you off the broom. It would just

03:29:49.540 --> 03:29:51.588
mean the broom stays attached to you.

03:29:51.588 --> 03:30:02.750
TRAVIS: 22. Natural 19. Son of a bitch. A
million.

03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:04.455
SAM: Sure.

03:30:04.455 --> 03:30:07.161
MARISHA: I love that he's getting so cranky about
rolling natural 19s.

03:30:07.263 --> 03:30:14.858
TRAVIS: 19 points of damage. I mean, after six
rolls, you'd hope so.

03:30:14.858 --> 03:30:17.653
MATT: You made a save on each of those rolls?

03:30:17.653 --> 03:30:22.139
TRAVIS: I am so sorry. I thought after I got
through the first one it just dispelled it.

03:30:22.139 --> 03:30:23.582
MATT: Nope!

03:30:23.582 --> 03:30:26.473
TRAVIS: The first one was a 24, I think?

03:30:26.473 --> 03:30:27.538
MATT: Yes.

03:30:27.538 --> 03:30:28.888
TRAVIS: So you need to erase--

03:30:28.888 --> 03:30:30.901
MATT: Well, you have to roll saves for the next
two.

03:30:30.901 --> 03:30:37.503
TRAVIS: Oh, okay. I probably won't get through
him, though. 15?

03:30:37.503 --> 03:30:38.658
SAM: Nope.

03:30:38.658 --> 03:30:39.831
TRAVIS: 15.

03:30:39.831 --> 03:30:41.954
MATT: All right, so the last two attacks do no
damage.

03:30:41.954 --> 03:30:44.724
SAM: I live to see another day.

03:30:44.724 --> 03:30:47.281
TRAVIS: I'm sorry. I thought it dispelled it.

03:30:47.281 --> 03:30:48.830
MARISHA: Or 15 more seconds.

03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:56.249
SAM: Jesus Christ. I know that he takes acid
damage, right?

03:30:56.249 --> 03:30:58.760
MATT: Yes. He doesn't appear to be resistant to
acid damage.

03:30:58.760 --> 03:31:07.682
SAM: Okay, then I will throw acid at him. In
the face!

03:31:07.682 --> 03:31:11.237
MATT: Two-Face style.

03:31:11.237 --> 03:31:15.532
SAM: Yeah, the acid drop. It's a dex save.

03:31:15.532 --> 03:31:18.180
MATT: It's a dex save on you, Grog, to try and
avoid it.

03:31:18.180 --> 03:31:21.419
TRAVIS: 15?

03:31:21.419 --> 03:31:23.441
MATT: What's your DC?

03:31:23.441 --> 03:31:24.667
SAM: 17.

03:31:24.667 --> 03:31:26.621
MATT: No. Full damage on this.

03:31:26.621 --> 03:31:28.296
LAURA: Oh shit!

03:31:28.296 --> 03:31:42.545
SAM: This could be it. Oh, this is it. Well,
maybe. 29.

03:31:42.545 --> 03:31:46.292
TRAVIS: Oh, 29 points of damage?

03:31:46.292 --> 03:31:50.516
MATT: Acid damage, yeah. Roll a constitution.

03:31:50.516 --> 03:31:53.857
TRAVIS: With the plus two to constitution from the
card.

03:31:53.857 --> 03:32:03.117
MATT: Well, plus one. The modifier gives you a
plus one. The DC is 15 this time.

03:32:03.117 --> 03:32:04.388
TRAVIS: 24.

03:32:04.388 --> 03:32:07.154
MATT: Okay. He stays up at one hit point.

03:32:07.154 --> 03:32:09.347
SAM: (screams) He's insane!

03:32:09.347 --> 03:32:11.668
MARISHA: He's undead!

03:32:11.668 --> 03:32:16.805
MATT: The DC's going to be 20, next time that
happens. You still have your movement.

03:32:16.805 --> 03:32:23.060
SAM: I'm going to go 50 feet anywhere. To the top
of that tower over there, I guess.

03:32:23.060 --> 03:32:24.241
MATT: Over here?

03:32:24.241 --> 03:32:30.254
SAM: Yeah. Can I get there? Or as far away from
him as I can get.

03:32:30.254 --> 03:32:35.422
MATT: You can get... all the way over here.

03:32:35.422 --> 03:32:38.076
SAM: I'm going to get lightninged, but that's
okay. I'll take it.

03:32:38.076 --> 03:32:41.346
MATT: It's better than a Grogning. All right, that
ends your turn.

03:32:41.346 --> 03:32:43.421
TRAVIS: You're on top of the fucking tower?

03:32:43.421 --> 03:32:52.080
MATT: Top of the round, the braziers all
(explosion noise) in the distance. No effect.

03:32:52.080 --> 03:32:53.546
Grog, your turn.

03:32:53.546 --> 03:33:01.111
TRAVIS: May I leap over the acid pit with the
Boots of Feral Leaping, knowing I might fall in.

03:33:01.111 --> 03:33:17.620
No, I'm in there. 23. Where are you going,
chicken? With my 50 feet of speed-- is there a

03:33:17.620 --> 03:33:19.328
chain hanging from the front of it?

03:33:19.328 --> 03:33:20.561
MATT: Yeah, right there.

03:33:20.561 --> 03:33:22.688
TRAVIS: Can I climb that with 50 feet of speed?
Probably not.

03:33:22.688 --> 03:33:25.197
MATT: You can climb it. We'll see how far you can
get.

03:33:25.197 --> 03:33:31.430
TRAVIS: No. I'm going to run into the tower and
start running up the stairs.

03:33:31.430 --> 03:33:39.375
MATT: You'll get partway into the first floor on
your 50. Are you going to dash

03:33:39.375 --> 03:33:41.127
to try and do the rest?

03:33:41.127 --> 03:33:43.001
TRAVIS: Yes, if it will get me to the top.

03:33:43.001 --> 03:33:44.645
MATT: It won't get you all the way to the top,
no.

03:33:44.645 --> 03:33:46.160
TRAVIS: Okay, that's fine. I'll dash.

03:33:46.160 --> 03:33:53.339
MATT: Okay, you'll get-- with your dash, into the
third floor, almost to the hatch. So you're up in

03:33:53.339 --> 03:33:55.778
the third floor right now. Tary?

03:33:55.778 --> 03:34:01.398
SAM: (giggles) I casually walk down the stairs.

03:34:01.398 --> 03:34:14.602
MATT: You come to the hatch, and Grog rushes up
into the third floor there. As you come down in

03:34:14.602 --> 03:34:16.083
the hatch.

03:34:16.083 --> 03:34:20.565
TRAVIS: I have a request. With your hands.
Please.

03:34:20.565 --> 03:34:21.780
SAM: With my hands?

03:34:21.780 --> 03:34:22.770
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:34:22.770 --> 03:34:23.905
LAURA: Don't.

03:34:23.905 --> 03:34:25.163
TRAVIS: I'm a simple man.

03:34:25.163 --> 03:34:34.212
SAM: All right. I can do that. (laughing) I can't
do that. You're so powerful. I'll probably miss!

03:34:34.212 --> 03:34:36.644
TRAVIS: You got it, man.

03:34:36.644 --> 03:34:41.483
SAM: If I miss, then I'm trapped in a room with
him!

03:34:41.483 --> 03:34:43.383
TRAVIS: I've got one hit point.

03:34:43.383 --> 03:34:45.208
SAM: But I could miss.

03:34:45.208 --> 03:34:47.196
LAURA: Kill him, Tary!

03:34:47.196 --> 03:34:51.079
TRAVIS: This is your chance to claim your bravery
for your house.

03:34:51.079 --> 03:34:52.385
SAM: Greatsword!

03:34:52.385 --> 03:34:55.228
MARISHA: You're getting him with a greatsword?

03:34:55.228 --> 03:34:58.187
SAM: That's what I've got. Greatsword.

03:34:58.187 --> 03:35:00.774
MATT: Your rod turns into a greatsword.

03:35:00.774 --> 03:35:03.428
TRAVIS: (laughing) The fucking thing.

03:35:03.428 --> 03:35:11.985
SAM: I'll do this crazy around and around thing
and try to do that with the greatsword. Oh, and

03:35:11.985 --> 03:35:14.230
can I set it on fire, first?

03:35:14.230 --> 03:35:15.167
MATT: Yes, you can.

03:35:15.167 --> 03:35:16.742
TRAVIS: Oh, good. Yeah.

03:35:16.742 --> 03:35:26.126
SAM: What am I rolling? What was that? 12 plus
eight plus two magic. That's 22.

03:35:26.126 --> 03:35:29.165
MATT: Hits. Roll damage.

03:35:29.165 --> 03:35:32.024
SAM: Three.

03:35:32.024 --> 03:35:35.469
MATT: Grog, make a constitution--

03:35:35.469 --> 03:35:38.284
SAM: Oh, it's 2d6. Four.

03:35:38.284 --> 03:35:41.237
(laughter)

03:35:41.237 --> 03:35:48.523
MATT: Roll a constitution saving throw. DC 20.

03:35:48.523 --> 03:35:50.688
TRAVIS: That's a natural 19.

03:35:50.688 --> 03:35:52.730
MARISHA: Oh my god, he's still fucking alive!

03:35:52.730 --> 03:35:54.189
SAM: What happened?!

03:35:54.189 --> 03:35:55.593
TRAVIS: Natural 19.

03:35:55.593 --> 03:35:57.182
SAM: (screams)

03:35:57.182 --> 03:35:59.730
TRAVIS: And I'd like to take my retaliation
strike.

03:35:59.730 --> 03:36:01.038
TALIESIN: Yeah!

03:36:01.038 --> 03:36:02.486
SAM: I still have movement.

03:36:02.486 --> 03:36:06.481
MATT: You do, after this. Retaliation is an
immediate reaction.

03:36:06.481 --> 03:36:20.233
SAM: I get a disengage. Didn't we go over this? I
did a melee weapon attack. Don't I get a disengage

03:36:20.233 --> 03:36:21.336
for free?

03:36:21.336 --> 03:36:25.480
MATT: As your feat, you mean?

03:36:25.480 --> 03:36:27.873
SAM: Yes! My Mobile feat.

03:36:27.873 --> 03:36:34.002
MATT: Right, but this isn't him getting a free
attack from you moving away. One of his barbarian

03:36:34.002 --> 03:36:37.729
abilities is if someone hits him with a melee
attack, he can immediately attack.

03:36:37.800 --> 03:36:39.168
SAM: Okay.

03:36:39.168 --> 03:36:41.631
MATT: He goaded you right into doing what he
wanted.

03:36:41.631 --> 03:36:43.212
TALIESIN: Oh my god.

03:36:43.212 --> 03:36:45.770
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

03:36:45.770 --> 03:36:47.837
SAM: Enough.

03:36:47.837 --> 03:36:49.322
TRAVIS: Oh, okay.

03:36:49.322 --> 03:36:50.669
MATT: Make your attack, Grog.

03:36:50.669 --> 03:36:56.911
TRAVIS: Reckless. Come on, natural 20. No. 27.

03:36:56.911 --> 03:36:58.974
SAM: To hit? Sure.

03:36:58.974 --> 03:37:04.263
TRAVIS: 25 points of damage.

03:37:04.263 --> 03:37:05.810
SAM: That hurts.

03:37:05.810 --> 03:37:07.485
TRAVIS: But not enough.

03:37:07.485 --> 03:37:14.728
SAM: It hurts you, because I have a Shield of Fire
that burns anybody who attacks me with a melee

03:37:14.728 --> 03:37:19.720
attack. With 2d8 cold damage.

03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:27.659
TRAVIS: This fucking magic is too much for this
barbarian. I mean, goddamn. People are turning

03:37:27.659 --> 03:37:31.501
into flames, dragons, running around in a fucking
hamster ball,

03:37:31.501 --> 03:37:34.619
setting me on fucking cold damage...

03:37:34.619 --> 03:37:36.206
MATT: Roll some cold damage.

03:37:36.206 --> 03:37:38.287
SAM: Two. Nine.

03:37:38.287 --> 03:37:40.813
MATT: Make another constitution check with a DC
25, Grog.

03:37:40.813 --> 03:37:42.551
MARISHA: DC 25!

03:37:42.551 --> 03:37:51.071
LAURA: He has to roll a natural 20 in order to get
this. No. He has to roll a 19.

03:37:51.071 --> 03:37:53.581
SAM: He gets two rolls.

03:37:53.581 --> 03:37:58.573
TRAVIS: I have plus 12 as the modifier to the
roll. My constitution is plus 12.

03:37:58.573 --> 03:38:02.030
LAURA: Oh, a saving throw? Oh shit.

03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:05.147
TRAVIS: So I have to roll-- what's the math on
that?

03:38:05.147 --> 03:38:06.478
MATT: It's a 25.

03:38:06.478 --> 03:38:08.377
TRAVIS: 17 or higher?

03:38:08.377 --> 03:38:10.853
LAURA: It's not even that much. It's a 13 or
higher.

03:38:10.853 --> 03:38:15.505
MARISHA: He's going to make it.

03:38:15.505 --> 03:38:18.233
TRAVIS: Seven.

03:38:18.233 --> 03:38:20.981
MATT: Taryon, how do you want to do this?

03:38:20.981 --> 03:38:31.694
SAM: I want him to hit the blazing TD on my chest
and have the might of my name ricochet back with

03:38:31.694 --> 03:38:36.568
the power of energy. The Darrington name strikes
him down.

03:38:36.568 --> 03:38:45.430
MATT: The cold shatters you, and you feel the
ribcage break like brittle glass on the inside of

03:38:45.430 --> 03:38:50.784
your chest from the blast backward. You fall to
your knees, unable to move a muscle. You can feel

03:38:50.784 --> 03:38:55.858
the life barely beating through. Your body is
heaving with each heartbeat pulse. He's prostrate

03:38:55.858 --> 03:38:57.503
before you, Taryon, as you approach.

03:38:57.503 --> 03:39:05.804
SAM: I say, Doty, take this down. I win. And I
kick him over.

03:39:05.804 --> 03:39:12.978
MATT: As you hit the ground, as the last of the
cold damage has curled over your body and freezes

03:39:12.978 --> 03:39:20.105
you solid, you (shattering) shatter into thousands
of small, frozen pieces. The last T2 reference of

03:39:20.105 --> 03:39:31.697
the night, yep. As Taryon Darrington stands victor
of this round. As you stand there, breathing

03:39:31.697 --> 03:39:38.062
heavily, suddenly the stone top of the tower
cracks open, like it's being pulled apart by giant,

03:39:38.062 --> 03:39:45.632
invisible hands. And there you see, descending
from above, a gentleman in a large, dark cloak and

03:39:45.632 --> 03:39:54.484
a magnificent beard, and a glorious, well-kept
mane of hair. He lands. "Let this blessing of

03:39:54.484 --> 03:40:01.577
"Colville carry you into any dimension." He touches
your forehead and you feel the fates reach into

03:40:01.577 --> 03:40:09.738
you and plant you with a seed of possibility. And
then with that, a flash is gone. You awaken in

03:40:09.738 --> 03:40:16.852
your bed. Cold sweat. The next morning after you
went to sleep. You're not as powerful as you felt

03:40:16.852 --> 03:40:23.970
before. That was a crazy dream. But you look down
and you see this slight glow of white light across

03:40:23.970 --> 03:40:31.081
your sternum from underneath your silk pajamas,
and then it fades, and you feel like something

03:40:31.081 --> 03:40:36.945
from that dream is holding on. And that's where
we're going to end our game tonight.

03:40:36.945 --> 03:40:39.073
(cheering)

03:40:39.073 --> 03:40:40.519
TRAVIS: You got your fate dice.

03:40:40.519 --> 03:40:45.977
LAURA: Oh my god. And your parents are named after
Tony Stark's parents. How crazy is that?

03:40:45.977 --> 03:40:47.736
SAM: Oh, wait. They are?

03:40:47.736 --> 03:40:49.928
TRAVIS: How many hit points did you have left?

03:40:49.928 --> 03:40:51.283
SAM: I still had 30 or something.

03:40:51.283 --> 03:40:54.244
TALIESIN: He had 25.

03:40:54.244 --> 03:40:59.083
MATT: I'm curious. Where were you going to try and
Plane Shift Grog?

03:40:59.083 --> 03:41:02.690
MARISHA: Water Plane. Water dimension. You would
have just drowned.

03:41:02.690 --> 03:41:04.230
TALIESIN: Solid.

03:41:04.230 --> 03:41:09.743
MARISHA: I didn't know your charisma was-- I
thought you had zero.

03:41:09.743 --> 03:41:11.492
TRAVIS: It's plus one.

03:41:11.492 --> 03:41:17.532
MARISHA: All he had to roll was an 18 or lower.
Anything else.

03:41:17.532 --> 03:41:21.102
TRAVIS: That's why I was like, ugh, it's a 19.

03:41:21.102 --> 03:41:25.283
LAURA: Oh man. That was awesome.

03:41:25.283 --> 03:41:26.784
MATT: That was a great battle, guys.

03:41:26.784 --> 03:41:32.253
TRAVIS: That was a great map! That map was
amazing.

03:41:32.253 --> 03:41:35.285
MATT: I'm glad you guys had fun. I was hoping it
would be fun.

03:41:35.285 --> 03:41:38.467
TRAVIS: The three different varying--

03:41:38.467 --> 03:41:41.095
SAM: It was like a paintball field.

03:41:41.095 --> 03:41:45.895
MATT: That's what I wanted to make it feel like.
Little bunker areas.

03:41:45.895 --> 03:41:49.573
LAURA: You did have places that people that were
flying could hide.

03:41:49.573 --> 03:41:50.810
MATT: Yeah.

03:41:50.810 --> 03:41:55.373
TRAVIS: If we had tried to hit one of the spires
that created electricity,

03:41:55.373 --> 03:41:57.193
would that have ended that?

03:41:57.193 --> 03:42:02.395
MATT: Here? You could have destroyed it. Hitting
it would have done damage to it, but it would have

03:42:02.395 --> 03:42:04.585
prevented that from going off in that area.

03:42:04.585 --> 03:42:06.490
SAM: Were all the trunks the same thing?

03:42:06.490 --> 03:42:08.604
MATT: Yeah, each trunk had one healing potion. It
was whoever got there first.

03:42:08.604 --> 03:42:10.011
TALIESIN: And there was one trunk left?

03:42:10.011 --> 03:42:11.578
MATT: One trunk left that nobody went to.

03:42:11.578 --> 03:42:12.425
TRAVIS: Which one?

03:42:12.425 --> 03:42:14.631
MARISHA: The one that I was in for a lot of the
time.

03:42:14.631 --> 03:42:16.313
TALIESIN: I kept thinking about telling you.

03:42:16.313 --> 03:42:20.078
TRAVIS: Oh, really? The one down here in the lower
left?

03:42:20.078 --> 03:42:21.362
TALIESIN: Yeah, bottom left.

03:42:21.362 --> 03:42:23.430
MARISHA: It was the one I was camping out in.

03:42:23.430 --> 03:42:25.833
TALIESIN: But it wasn't my turn, so I didn't say
anything.

03:42:25.833 --> 03:42:30.203
MARISHA: I almost thought about taking it just so
no one else could have it, but never got to it.

03:42:30.203 --> 03:42:31.609
MATT: Well done, guys.

03:42:31.609 --> 03:42:34.532
TALIESIN: (giggles) That was nuts.

03:42:34.532 --> 03:42:41.783
MATT: Oh man. Well, when this campaign arc's over
and we have everybody available, hopefully, we'll

03:42:41.783 --> 03:42:47.325
probably have one final battle royale with
everyone max level, with Vax, with Pike, and see

03:42:47.325 --> 03:42:52.366
who comes through on that one. And whatever gift
boon I decide for that one, if it's similar or the

03:42:52.366 --> 03:42:55.263
same, will probably carry over to the next
campaign for their first new characters.

03:42:55.263 --> 03:42:56.632
Should be fun.

03:42:56.632 --> 03:43:00.465
MARISHA: Level 20 Keyleth is nasty. I get
unlimited Shapechange.

03:43:00.465 --> 03:43:08.177
TRAVIS: What do you mean, is nasty? You are nasty!
You were like the fucking Conclave. Jesus. The

03:43:08.177 --> 03:43:09.921
only thing you didn't turn into was a giant.

03:43:09.921 --> 03:43:11.764
MARISHA: I thought I was going to take the light
down.

03:43:11.764 --> 03:43:14.431
MATT: You had a 90% chance of just disappearing
and drowning.

03:43:14.431 --> 03:43:20.026
MARISHA: Yeah. I thought that's what he was going
to fucking do. I can't believe that.

03:43:20.026 --> 03:43:22.188
TRAVIS: That's true, yeah.

03:43:22.188 --> 03:43:24.963
MARISHA: You would have bamfed, and then it would
have been down to Tary and I.

03:43:24.963 --> 03:43:27.540
LAURA: I had no idea you could break out of my
fucking necklace!

03:43:27.540 --> 03:43:29.493
MATT: Nobody tried.

03:43:29.493 --> 03:43:34.019
TALIESIN: There's so many ways that you could have
died tonight.

03:43:34.019 --> 03:43:36.377
MARISHA: Yeah, you could have died 80 times.

03:43:36.377 --> 03:43:42.766
TALIESIN: If that glove had worked, I would have
had an action surge and five shots to the head.

03:43:42.766 --> 03:43:47.445
MATT: It's the balance to the necklace so you
can't just imprison the main big bad guy of

03:43:47.445 --> 03:43:52.278
something and be like, "Oh, that's over because he
rolled poor." It will help for a while, but if he

03:43:52.278 --> 03:43:55.932
stays in there for a long time and he's
intelligent, he'll eventually find a way out. It's

03:43:55.932 --> 03:43:57.416
an imperfect prison.

03:43:57.416 --> 03:44:00.526
TALIESIN: It's a wicker basket.

03:44:00.526 --> 03:44:03.192
TRAVIS: And the Deck, yet again, didn't harm me.

03:44:03.192 --> 03:44:07.040
LAURA: Well, you don't know that because it was
all a dream in Tary's fucking head.

03:44:07.040 --> 03:44:13.297
MARISHA: You pulling that knight probably changed
things because he did just enough damage to me to

03:44:13.297 --> 03:44:14.680
make it a pain in the ass.

03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:17.406
TALIESIN: That plus two to modifier? There's a
lot.

03:44:17.406 --> 03:44:22.025
SAM: The cards were amazing!

03:44:22.025 --> 03:44:26.602
MATT: I'm going to hold onto those, if that's
okay. I want to use those from now on. Oh, that

03:44:26.602 --> 03:44:27.974
was so much fun.

03:44:27.974 --> 03:44:29.689
TALIESIN: Came in the mail a little while ago.

03:44:29.689 --> 03:44:33.692
TRAVIS: Taryon Darrington, champion of the battle
royale.

03:44:33.692 --> 03:44:39.701
MATT: Two clerics and an artificer are our
reigning champions in the battles, guys.

03:44:39.701 --> 03:44:40.818
MARISHA: Two clerics?

03:44:40.818 --> 03:44:43.225
TRAVIS: Kashaw won the first.

03:44:43.225 --> 03:44:44.525
MATT: Then Pike.

03:44:44.525 --> 03:44:51.407
MARISHA: That's right, Kash. And I was the
runner-up with Pike, too! Goddamn it.

03:44:51.407 --> 03:44:54.777
MATT: And then Pike pushed your face into lava.

03:44:54.777 --> 03:44:56.614
MARISHA: I wasn't the runner-up tonight.

03:44:56.614 --> 03:45:00.441
TALIESIN: I went down hard, man.

03:45:00.441 --> 03:45:01.859
LAURA: You did go down hard.

03:45:01.859 --> 03:45:03.068
MATT: Oh, Percy.

03:45:03.068 --> 03:45:04.460
SAM: You got hammered to death so soon.

03:45:04.460 --> 03:45:09.610
TALIESIN: Again, if the glove had worked, it would
have been amazing. That would have been an ugly,

03:45:09.610 --> 03:45:11.037
terrible death for Grog.

03:45:11.037 --> 03:45:18.131
MATT: You had some bad rolls. You, more so than
anybody in this party-- maybe Grog, but Grog had

03:45:18.131 --> 03:45:22.746
to still get there-- you, with an action surge and
some good rolls, you can pretty much take down

03:45:22.746 --> 03:45:24.535
almost any member in one round.

03:45:24.535 --> 03:45:25.778
TALIESIN: With good rolls.

03:45:25.778 --> 03:45:26.773
MATT: With good rolls.

03:45:26.773 --> 03:45:32.371
MARISHA: You jammed all of your guns. I can't
believe you jammed all of your guns.

03:45:32.371 --> 03:45:36.298
TALIESIN: Not only that, but the gun that does
damage when it jams jammed twice.

03:45:36.298 --> 03:45:38.000
LAURA: All of your war paint is gone.

03:45:38.000 --> 03:45:39.952
MARISHA: How did you do that?

03:45:39.952 --> 03:45:43.236
SAM: Oh my god, it's gone. Did you go wash your
face?

03:45:43.236 --> 03:45:47.114
LAURA: No, he's just been wiping his face the
whole night. It's all over his hands, probably.

03:45:47.114 --> 03:45:48.698
TALIESIN: Show us your hands.

03:45:48.698 --> 03:45:49.965
LAURA: No, don't.

03:45:49.965 --> 03:45:52.605
SAM: Your sheets tonight are going to be nasty.

03:45:52.605 --> 03:45:54.823
TALIESIN: You're going to be hard to see in the
forest.

03:45:54.823 --> 03:46:03.661
MATT: Well done, guys. Thank you guys for playing.
Hope you guys enjoyed watching. We'll see you guys

03:46:03.661 --> 03:46:11.326
next week to pick up the next leg of the
adventure, as we left off right as you were

03:46:11.326 --> 03:46:19.833
exiting the platinum mines with the swarm of
ankhegs below you. We'll pick up from there next

03:46:19.833 --> 03:46:23.944
week. We'll have Jon Heder as a guest, which I
got to coordinate with him to get his story stuff

03:46:23.944 --> 03:46:32.019
figured out. We'll talk. And the week after that
will be our 100th episode. That's fucking crazy!

03:46:32.019 --> 03:46:33.824
LAURA: I mean, how?

03:46:33.824 --> 03:46:38.219
SAM: Well, some of them weren't that good. So
really only 60.

03:46:38.219 --> 03:46:40.526
TALIESIN: I think 20th episode, really.

03:46:40.526 --> 03:46:46.329
MATT: There's a lot of people who went, "yeah."
And I don't blame you! But we're having fun.

03:46:46.329 --> 03:46:50.978
That's what matters. So looking forward to
that. We should have some fun surprises on the

03:46:50.978 --> 03:46:56.547
100th episode. We're excited about that. Anyway,
much love to you guys. Have a wonderful night, and

03:46:56.547 --> 03:46:59.000
is it Thursday yet? See you soon.
