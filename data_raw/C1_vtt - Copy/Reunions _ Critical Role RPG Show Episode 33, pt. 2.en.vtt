00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.555
MATT: Instead of using the table, though, you use
Grog's knee. You just run, jump onto his knee with

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.959
one foot, leap off, blade in the air, go for the
strike.

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:06.891
MARISHA: That's cool!

00:00:06.891 --> 00:00:10.394
LAURA: You can do it, Scanlan! (laughs)

00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:11.593
SAM: What do I add?

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:12.543
MARISHA: Your attack bonus.

00:00:12.543 --> 00:00:13.706
MATT: Attack bonus for your weapon.

00:00:13.706 --> 00:00:14.606
SAM: I don't know what that is!

00:00:14.606 --> 00:00:16.293
(laughter)

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:17.495
TRAVIS: It is never used.

00:00:17.495 --> 00:00:18.958
SAM: Okay. It's a plus seven!

00:00:18.958 --> 00:00:19.959
MATT: Yeah, so?

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:20.805
SAM: 15.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:21.902
(laughter)

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.961
MATT: As you rush in the air, you hesitate for a
moment, remembering the Pike thing, and you see

00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:29.056
this burning arcane rage in the face of this
entity. At that moment, that hesitation was all it

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:34.038
needed. It takes the shield and almost knocks the
weapon out of your hand. You catch yourself, land

00:00:34.038 --> 00:00:41.343
on your feet-- yeah, your fingers sting a little
bit. (laughs) Worth a shot. All right, in

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:46.482
retribution, it's going to strike at you twice.
That's a 15?

00:00:46.482 --> 00:00:48.519
SAM: That fails.

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:49.650
MATT: 21.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.095
SAM: That is successful.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:52.547
MATT: That is seven points of slashing damage.

00:00:52.547 --> 00:00:53.547
SAM: Okay.

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.968
MATT: All right. Keyleth, you're up.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:59.832
MARISHA: Ugh. You guys, I thought someone was
going to kill him!

00:00:59.832 --> 00:01:03.359
SAM: I tried, but he hurt my wrist really bad!

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.773
MARISHA: I know, because I don't want to fucking
burn any spells on this asshole.

00:01:08.773 --> 00:01:10.117
TALIESIN: Just hit him with your stick.

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:11.316
MARISHA: Just-- ugh. God.

00:01:11.316 --> 00:01:13.248
MATT: Roll for it.

00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:17.115
MARISHA: Goddamn it, this hopefully works-- nope.

00:01:17.115 --> 00:01:18.277
TALIESIN: No! Wow!

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.145
MARISHA: Nope, that didn't work. (tink)

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:21.876
(laughter)

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.663
MATT: Heavy armor on these guys. All right. Vex,
you're up.

00:01:24.663 --> 00:01:28.014
LAURA: Oh gosh. I guess I shoot him. Can I see him
to shoot him?

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:32.011
MATT: I'll say yeah, you can see him all right.
You can move over there and get a better view a

00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:34.143
little bit. Just around this corner, off the
table.

00:01:34.143 --> 00:01:35.572
LAURA: And I'm going to Hunter's Mark him.

00:01:35.572 --> 00:01:36.442
MATT: Hunter's Mark him?

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:37.370
LAURA: And then I'm going to shoot him.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.758
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:48.784
LAURA: Oh gosh, I'm just so nervous about picking
the 20. No. 19?

00:01:48.784 --> 00:01:52.852
MATT: 19? The arrow hits the armor and shatters
across the side.

00:01:52.852 --> 00:01:53.905
LAURA: Shit.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:55.111
TRAVIS: 19?

00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.619
LAURA: 24.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.026
MATT: 24 does hit.

00:01:58.026 --> 00:01:58.905
LAURA: Okay.

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:01.579
TALIESIN: Yay, you hurt it.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.154
LAURA: Well, maybe.

00:02:03.154 --> 00:02:05.871
TRAVIS: That's a high AC. Because of the shield,
right?

00:02:05.871 --> 00:02:07.909
MATT: Because of the shield and the armor.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:08.853
LAURA: 18.

00:02:08.853 --> 00:02:13.677
MATT: 18 points of damage? With that, the second
arrow strikes into the center of its chest armor.

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:20.486
It hits some sort of core where its arcane form is
held and the reddish energy blinks out, and the armor

00:02:20.486 --> 00:02:22.500
just (impact noise) crumples to the ground.

00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:24.439
TRAVIS: That's two of them!

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.114
LAURA: What's up, bitches?

00:02:26.114 --> 00:02:27.759
TRAVIS: That was tough.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:34.305
MARISHA: Okay, I immediately turn my attention to
Cassandra. Can I do a medical check on her to make

00:02:34.305 --> 00:02:35.558
sure she's okay?

00:02:35.558 --> 00:02:37.245
MATT: Go ahead and make a medicine check, yeah.

00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:38.269
TRAVIS: Where's Ripley?

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.446
SAM: I start running out the hall to Ripley.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:41.354
TRAVIS: Me, as well.

00:02:41.354 --> 00:02:43.417
LAURA: Oh, Trinket is still running after her,
too.

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:47.863
MATT: All right, make a perception check for
Trinket.

00:02:47.863 --> 00:02:51.298
LAURA: Oh. (laughs) Okay, is it his smelling?

00:02:51.298 --> 00:02:53.388
MATT: Yeah, it's his wisdom bonus.

00:02:53.388 --> 00:02:58.298
LAURA: I'm rolling a big dice for Trinket! Oh,
that's good. 26!

00:02:58.298 --> 00:02:59.667
MATT: 26, okay.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:00.839
LAURA: 25.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.072
MATT: 25, okay. Trinket is giving chase best it
can.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:10.382
LAURA: Except wait. Hold on, I get advantage
because he's got advantage on smell perception.

00:03:10.382 --> 00:03:12.637
Oh, it's the same thing.

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:18.383
MATT: Okay, so Trinket is keeping track, but is
having a hard time fully keeping up at this point

00:03:18.383 --> 00:03:24.745
unless you're giving full attention towards him at
this point in time, but is keeping a track. He is

00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:28.866
rushing as fast as he can down the stairs and is
currently out of your sphere of personal influence

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:29.938
at the moment.

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:32.057
LAURA: I should have Hunter's Marked her. (sighs)

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:35.850
TRAVIS: I grab Scanlan, and we're taking off 
after her out the door.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.804
MARISHA: I rolled a 17 on a medicine check.

00:03:37.867 --> 00:03:46.943
MATT: Okay, checking Cassandra, there is no sign
of a wound now. She seems to be not in any

00:03:47.011 --> 00:03:48.298
danger.

00:03:48.298 --> 00:03:49.660
MARISHA: Okay.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:51.586
MATT: So, she's on the ground, dazed.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:55.896
TALIESIN: I'm going to collapse in a corner for a
minute and start using my ascot to clean some of

00:03:55.896 --> 00:04:00.534
the gore off my weapon and my clothing and my
mask.

00:04:00.534 --> 00:04:02.424
MATT: It is a lot of gore. Okay.

00:04:02.424 --> 00:04:04.096
LIAM: Are we out of combat now?

00:04:04.096 --> 00:04:05.313
MATT: You guys are currently out of combat.

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:13.437
LIAM: Okay. I'm going to, clutching my bleeding
belly, walk over toward Keyleth and say, that was

00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:15.499
a close one.

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:23.061
MARISHA: Yeah. You know, I feel like we've been
here before-- oh, right. We have been here

00:04:23.061 --> 00:04:25.113
before.

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:27.862
LIAM: You know I'm in love with you, right? 
And I kiss her.

00:04:27.862 --> 00:04:29.045
SAM: Oh!

00:04:29.045 --> 00:04:33.427
TALIESIN: (coughs heavily)

00:04:33.427 --> 00:04:34.983
SAM: Persistent cough.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:39.352
MATT: (laughs) And on that note, we're going to go
ahead and take a quick little break!

00:04:39.352 --> 00:04:41.015
LAURA: What the fuck?!

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:46.344
MATT: (laughs) All right, quick break!

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:48.698
TALIESIN: I want to see what color you turned. Oh
my god, yeah!

00:04:48.698 --> 00:04:50.318
(laughter)

00:04:50.318 --> 00:04:53.604
MATT: All right, awesome. Quick break, guys! See
you guys back here in a few minutes.

00:04:53.604 --> 00:04:55.381
TRAVIS: Dude, what?!

00:04:55.381 --> 00:14:02.384
[break]

00:14:02.384 --> 00:14:06.563
ZAC: Couple quick things, guys, or I could just
sit here and talk for a good ten minutes, make you

00:14:06.563 --> 00:14:11.699
guys wait before we come back to the bombshell
that was dropped. I'm just going to keep going. We

00:14:11.699 --> 00:14:16.353
are 15 away from doing a giveaway, if we hit that
15 we will be doing that giveaway at the very end

00:14:16.353 --> 00:14:21.955
of this stream, right whenever Matt says that's
it. We will open up the chat for everyone and do

00:14:21.955 --> 00:14:25.062
that giveaway. I also want to say for all the
people wondering what in the world was the No

00:14:25.062 --> 00:14:30.448
Survivors thing, Snakes on a Plane number one was
this last Monday, and it's up on the website right

00:14:30.448 --> 00:14:33.525
now if you guys are curious and want to check it
out, it's probably the funniest thing we've ever

00:14:33.525 --> 00:14:37.861
done on this channel, and I don't say that
lightly. But we're doing Snakes on a Plane 2 this

00:14:37.861 --> 00:14:39.960
coming Monday, so thanks, guys.

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.774
MATT: Hell yeah.

00:14:40.774 --> 00:14:42.717
TALIESIN: Snakes on a Plane 2: More Snakes, More
Plane.

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:50.544
MATT: All right. So. With the chaos that has
ensued through the battle in Anders's study in the

00:14:50.544 --> 00:14:57.840
castle of Whitestone, the party looks about,
Cassandra de Rolo recovered, and pulled from

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:06.061
seemingly the brink of death. Vax pulled seemingly
from the brink of death, and Percy managing to

00:15:06.061 --> 00:15:12.503
squeak in a second killshot on a member of his
list. As the rest period kicks in, Vax stepped

00:15:12.503 --> 00:15:17.391
across the room, holding his wound to his side,
admitting his affection for Keyleth, and reaching

00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:18.816
out and kissing her.

00:15:18.816 --> 00:15:22.043
TRAVIS: Or attempting to kiss.

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:24.590
LAURA: Roll for contact there?

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.885
SAM: Roll for tongue action.

00:15:26.885 --> 00:15:27.952
MATT: No.

00:15:27.952 --> 00:15:29.128
LIAM: No.

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:36.617
MATT: So, as he breaks from the momentary,
unexpected embrace, you catch yourself off guard.

00:15:36.617 --> 00:15:43.611
LIAM: You know, the way you turn into animals and
stuff is really cool.

00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:47.107
TALIESIN: I'm going to collect some of Vex's
arrows.

00:15:47.107 --> 00:15:49.712
MARISHA: Are you sure you're--

00:15:49.712 --> 00:15:52.084
LAURA: I leave the room and look for Trinket.

00:15:52.084 --> 00:16:04.308
MARISHA: Just... let me. And I Cure Wounds him.
I'll do a 4th level. Shut up, Sam. I just can't

00:16:04.308 --> 00:16:08.464
find my spell. Yeah, I'll do that 4th-level Cure
Wounds.

00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:14.053
MATT: Burn all the spell slots. Go ahead and
roll.

00:16:14.053 --> 00:16:17.217
LIAM: Folks, we don't know what we're doing. None
of us know what we're doing.

00:16:17.217 --> 00:16:23.143
MARISHA: I feel like in the moment I would just do
it really at a-- shut up.

00:16:23.143 --> 00:16:24.611
SAM: Sure, overcompensate.

00:16:24.611 --> 00:16:34.896
MARISHA: Right. What do I roll? Hang on. 1d8. So
I'm rolling 4d8. I need d8s, goddamn it!

00:16:34.896 --> 00:16:35.965
Give me d8s.

00:16:35.965 --> 00:16:38.916
TALIESIN: You can't have my d8s.

00:16:38.916 --> 00:16:40.403
MARISHA: Why can't I have your d8s?

00:16:40.403 --> 00:16:41.803
TALIESIN: Okay, fine, have my d8s.

00:16:41.803 --> 00:16:43.609
MARISHA: That's fine, give me one more.

00:16:43.609 --> 00:16:45.172
MATT: All right.

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:48.908
MARISHA: Okay, 14, 18. (counting)

00:16:48.908 --> 00:16:50.210
MATT: What are you doing?

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:58.147
TALIESIN: I'm collecting three or four of Vex's
arrows from the ground and getting them in my

00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:03.255
hand, and I'm staying back from all of this and
letting it happen.

00:17:03.255 --> 00:17:08.711
MATT: Okay. Collect the arrows, Vex has stepped
out of the room to pursue after Trinket, Trinket

00:17:08.711 --> 00:17:12.069
is currently pursuing Ripley. Grog, you watched
that happen.

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.798
TRAVIS: No, Grog and Scanlan ran out of the room
after Ripley.

00:17:14.798 --> 00:17:16.498
MATT: Okay, have you guys bolted out? Okay.

00:17:16.498 --> 00:17:17.948
TRAVIS: We're yelling out, Ripley!

00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:19.671
SAM: Ripley!

00:17:19.671 --> 00:17:21.271
TALIESIN: Vax, are you all right?

00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:23.072
SAM: We shouldn't yell, Grog.

00:17:23.072 --> 00:17:24.676
TRAVIS: Fuck that. I yell anyway.

00:17:24.676 --> 00:17:25.993
LIAM: Was there a total?

00:17:25.993 --> 00:17:26.970
MARISHA: 33.

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:31.681
LIAM: Yes, I feel better. Thank you.

00:17:31.681 --> 00:17:36.740
TALIESIN: That's good. I'm going to now take my
handful of what is now basically a switch, and I'm

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.521
going to start whacking him with it really hard on
the chest.

00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:40.701
LIAM: Who?

00:17:40.701 --> 00:17:45.257
TALIESIN: You! Don't go into rooms by yourself,
god damn it!

00:17:45.257 --> 00:17:48.733
MARISHA: I back into a corner upon seeing this, as
Percy ruins the moment.

00:17:48.733 --> 00:17:55.648
LIAM: Percival, he had a knife to your sister's
throat. He was going to kill her.

00:17:55.648 --> 00:17:59.468
TALIESIN: Thank you, but count to ten. And now I
drop them and go over to my sister.

00:17:59.468 --> 00:18:03.597
LIAM: I was afraid she was going to die.

00:18:03.597 --> 00:18:07.006
MARISHA: To be fair, you did get her throat slit,
but it's okay.

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:12.585
MATT: As you're saying this, you turn around, you
can see she's sat up and she sees this

00:18:12.585 --> 00:18:16.446
conversation and goes, "Percy?"

00:18:16.446 --> 00:18:18.226
TALIESIN: Hi.

00:18:18.226 --> 00:18:20.789
MATT: "Percy!"

00:18:20.789 --> 00:18:22.576
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry.

00:18:22.576 --> 00:18:26.719
MATT: And she gets up off the ground and runs up
and just grabs you and embraces you tightly. You

00:18:26.719 --> 00:18:30.070
can feel all the muscles tense in her body as she
just holds you with a slight shake to her body.

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:33.392
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry for leaving you.

00:18:33.392 --> 00:18:37.652
MATT: "I thought you were dead." She pulls away
for a second and just looks at you, and there's a

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:46.078
coldness to her face. She's happy, but even for
her young age, you can see there's lines at the

00:18:46.078 --> 00:18:55.574
corners of her eyes. She's probably been through a
lot. She smiles and looks up at you again and you

00:18:55.574 --> 00:19:00.903
can see there's the white shocks in her hair, and
she looks up and touches your hair and goes, "I see

00:19:00.903 --> 00:19:04.595
"we've both survived quite a bit."

00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:05.941
TALIESIN: I wouldn't trade.

00:19:05.941 --> 00:19:11.797
MATT: She laughs to herself, and you see another
tear curl at her eye, and then her face goes cold

00:19:11.797 --> 00:19:18.586
for a second and she, not breaking this gaze,
steps back. "You shouldn't be here. They were

00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:20.797
"using me to get to you. I'm so sorry."

00:19:20.797 --> 00:19:24.562
TALIESIN: Are you all right? Did they do anything?
Are you yourself?

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:33.977
MATT: She reaches up and holds her neck. "I'm
good. I'm good." And she steels herself for a

00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:39.028
second, and even more so, you see there's an
intensity to her.

00:19:39.028 --> 00:19:40.369
TALIESIN: Perception check?

00:19:40.369 --> 00:19:41.444
MATT: To...?

00:19:41.444 --> 00:19:49.864
TALIESIN: Insight. I want to make sure she's not
holding anything really important back.

00:19:49.864 --> 00:19:51.473
MATT: Okay, go for it.

00:19:51.473 --> 00:20:00.147
TALIESIN: Insight? Do I get a bonus for that right
now? It's a wisdom-- yeah!

00:20:00.147 --> 00:20:01.825
MATT: No, because you were concentrating.

00:20:01.825 --> 00:20:03.268
TALIESIN: This is not a saving throw, though.

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.670
MATT: Yeah, and that's wisdom, not a saving
throw.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.605
TALIESIN: 11.

00:20:07.605 --> 00:20:19.396
MATT: 11. Okay. Best you can tell, she seems very
honest. She seems forthright. You're used to the

00:20:19.396 --> 00:20:26.402
memory of your sister being this bright-eyed,
cheerful, youngest of the bunch, and definitely a

00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:35.626
woman who sees the world with fresh eyes. These
eyes are different. They're colder. They're

00:20:35.626 --> 00:20:44.839
hardened. In ways, you're impressed; in ways,
you're also immediately sad to see that that

00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:48.261
memory of your sister probably is no longer
there.

00:20:48.261 --> 00:20:52.600
TALIESIN: We're putting an end to the Briarwoods
tonight. Before the sun sets. This is the end of

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:59.379
them. It's all going to be over, and we're going
to stop whatever it is they're doing

00:20:59.379 --> 00:21:01.244
under the city.

00:21:01.244 --> 00:21:04.481
MATT: "You say this. We've tried twice."

00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:08.888
TALIESIN: I know. This is it.

00:21:08.888 --> 00:21:21.145
MATT: "That's what the others thought. You left
me, you know."

00:21:21.145 --> 00:21:24.136
TALIESIN: I know, and I'm so sorry.

00:21:24.136 --> 00:21:32.002
MATT: "Good. Well, if we're going to do this,
let's get ready."

00:21:32.002 --> 00:21:35.829
TALIESIN: You're going to your room.

00:21:35.829 --> 00:21:36.920
MATT: "Yes, I am."

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.519
TALIESIN: To wait until this is over.

00:21:38.519 --> 00:21:47.044
MATT: "No. No, I'm not. I'm going to my room to
get my things. To get my mother's armor."

00:21:47.044 --> 00:21:54.644
TALIESIN: (sputters) You're-- I don't think that's
a very good idea.

00:21:54.644 --> 00:22:00.366
MATT: "You've been fighting them for what, a few
days? I've been fighting them for nearly three

00:22:00.366 --> 00:22:09.086
"years. You have no power over me, brother. And if
our goals are aligned to free this city, let's do

00:22:09.086 --> 00:22:12.491
"it together. But I don't have to listen to you."

00:22:12.491 --> 00:22:16.631
TALIESIN: God, you're irritating. Fine. Ugh!

00:22:16.631 --> 00:22:18.249
MATT: She walks out of the room.

00:22:18.249 --> 00:22:21.678
MARISHA: Percy!

00:22:21.678 --> 00:22:23.938
TALIESIN: She's so obnoxious. What?

00:22:23.938 --> 00:22:26.472
MARISHA: You have a sister.

00:22:26.472 --> 00:22:30.381
TALIESIN: Oh god, I do.

00:22:30.381 --> 00:22:39.289
MATT: You guys, charging off. Trinket's keeping
trail. She's run down the stairway, he is

00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:49.478
beginning to slowly gain on her. She reaches the
front doors, does remember the caltrops. Jumps

00:22:49.478 --> 00:22:55.826
over them, grabs the door, opens it, and rushes
out into the daylight. Go ahead and roll a

00:22:55.826 --> 00:22:58.149
perception check for Trinket.

00:22:58.149 --> 00:23:00.017
MARISHA: Oh, come on, Trinket.

00:23:00.017 --> 00:23:04.570
LAURA: He saw it happen! He's got really good
vision.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.612
MARISHA: Come on, Trink.

00:23:07.612 --> 00:23:08.770
TALIESIN: Yay!

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.409
LAURA: Oh yeah, that's like 24.

00:23:11.409 --> 00:23:18.029
MATT: Yeah, Trinket just jumps over. The door's
only slightly open so Trinket has to stop and

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.466
wedge his way through.

00:23:19.466 --> 00:23:21.657
LAURA: Can he cannonball into her? To try to catch
her?

00:23:21.657 --> 00:23:24.849
MATT: It's the same speed as if he dashed. It
would be the same speed.

00:23:24.849 --> 00:23:26.005
LAURA: All right.

00:23:26.005 --> 00:23:33.951
MATT: However, it takes a moment to get through.
You guys now get down the stairs. As Trinket opens

00:23:33.951 --> 00:23:44.607
the door and wedges through, there's a scent out
there, but she's nowhere in visible range. She's

00:23:44.666 --> 00:23:51.160
either darted off the path or possibly off the
actual sides, and you can see now the struggle

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:58.476
that's happened. You can now hear in the distance
the sound of yells and fighting and there doesn't

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:00.861
appear to be any one side or the other pushing.

00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:04.211
LAURA: I whistle at Trinket to get him to stop.

00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:06.617
MATT: Okay, as you get to the landing you whistle
out, and Trinket is just now pushing through the

00:24:06.617 --> 00:24:11.485
door and gets out for a bit, looking back and
forth. Looks over the shoulder, and runs back to

00:24:11.485 --> 00:24:16.834
you. It appears that Ripley has scattered into
Whitestone somewhere.

00:24:16.834 --> 00:24:18.440
SAM: Damn it.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.729
TRAVIS: We stop.

00:24:19.729 --> 00:24:21.731
MATT: Okay.

00:24:21.731 --> 00:24:24.323
LAURA: We need to find the Briarwoods.

00:24:24.323 --> 00:24:28.836
TALIESIN: I'm still upstairs. Are you going to
come meet us again upstairs?

00:24:28.836 --> 00:24:33.554
SAM: We'll get Trinket and go back upstairs,
wherever they are.

00:24:33.554 --> 00:24:36.836
TALIESIN: Taking a short rest.

00:24:36.836 --> 00:24:39.759
MARISHA: We're taking a short rest?

00:24:39.759 --> 00:24:43.767
TALIESIN: We're waiting there. They followed her
down; I'm waiting on Cassandra.

00:24:43.767 --> 00:24:46.847
TRAVIS: I could stay down in that foyer.

00:24:46.847 --> 00:24:48.084
TALIESIN: Come up.

00:24:48.084 --> 00:24:49.451
MATT: Are you waiting in the study?

00:24:49.451 --> 00:24:50.678
TALIESIN: Yeah, waiting in the study.

00:24:50.678 --> 00:24:53.962
MATT: Okay, she goes off to her room. You're there
for a few minutes.

00:24:53.962 --> 00:24:55.506
TALIESIN: Does Grog show up?

00:24:55.506 --> 00:25:06.829
SAM: We come back and say, that Ripley is very
talented. She got away. Talented Dr. Ripley.

00:25:06.829 --> 00:25:17.479
TALIESIN: We have bigger issues than Anna at this
point. Grog, do you have the Bag of Holding?

00:25:17.479 --> 00:25:18.561
TRAVIS: I do.

00:25:18.561 --> 00:25:21.986
TALIESIN: Can you scoop up what's left of
Professor Anders?

00:25:21.986 --> 00:25:28.853
LAURA: Can I loot him first? I mean, just see
what's on him.

00:25:28.853 --> 00:25:30.837
TRAVIS: Like, his head bits?

00:25:30.837 --> 00:25:36.712
TALIESIN: I don't want any of him sticking
around.

00:25:36.712 --> 00:25:38.612
MARISHA: Do we have to put him in the Bag of
Holding, though?

00:25:38.612 --> 00:25:40.262
TRAVIS: Why can't we just set him on fire?

00:25:40.262 --> 00:25:42.967
MARISHA: Yeah, stuff him in a closet or something
for now.

00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:45.579
TALIESIN: Fire will do.

00:25:45.579 --> 00:25:47.517
TRAVIS: Is there a fireplace in the room?

00:25:47.517 --> 00:25:49.622
TALIESIN: There is. Throw him in. Fine, we'll
throw him in the fire.

00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:52.463
LAURA: Wait. Let me see what's on him, first.

00:25:52.463 --> 00:25:55.090
MATT: Okay. Make an investigation check.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.714
TALIESIN: We don't want him coming back.

00:25:56.714 --> 00:26:02.177
MATT: He's crumpled up against the desk in the
corner, there's all these papers that got pushed

00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:04.931
off the side, there were a bunch of random
scrawlings.

00:26:04.931 --> 00:26:06.178
LAURA: 24.

00:26:06.178 --> 00:26:19.167
MATT: 24? Okay. You search his body. You find 120
gold pieces on him. Not a whole lot. He doesn't

00:26:19.167 --> 00:26:25.400
keep his important shit on him, for the most part.
You do find, however, the boots that he's wearing

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:34.468
are very finely crafted, and unlike the rest of
his wear, have a hand-stitching in it that is

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:40.562
exemplary in construction and doesn't match with
the rest of his ensemble. So it seems like

00:26:40.562 --> 00:26:44.188
something you'd wear more for function than for
actual style. Pardon.

00:26:44.188 --> 00:26:45.472
LAURA: I take them.

00:26:45.472 --> 00:26:47.152
MATT: You take them.

00:26:47.152 --> 00:26:48.319
TALIESIN: Take his shoes.

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:49.329
MATT: Okay.

00:26:49.329 --> 00:26:52.801
LAURA: Does anybody have magic? Can you see what
these are?

00:26:52.801 --> 00:26:54.542
SAM: Sure, I can look at them.

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:55.993
LAURA: Look at these, Scanlan.

00:26:55.993 --> 00:26:57.259
SAM: I look at them.

00:26:57.259 --> 00:27:00.894
MATT: Okay, if you're taking a short rest, you can
take the short rest to inspect the boots, get the

00:27:00.894 --> 00:27:08.319
feel for them, they are indeed enchanted. They are
a pair of Boots of Levitation. Once per day, you

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:14.259
can trigger the levitation for up to ten minutes
as per the spell. You can't actually move as part

00:27:14.259 --> 00:27:18.474
of it, you just levitate in the air, and you have
to push off to get space.

00:27:18.474 --> 00:27:19.783
TRAVIS: So like zero-G.

00:27:19.783 --> 00:27:20.617
MATT: Zero-G.

00:27:20.617 --> 00:27:21.764
TALIESIN: Like Willy Wonka.

00:27:21.764 --> 00:27:23.402
MARISHA: Zero-G boots! Oh, hell yeah.

00:27:23.402 --> 00:27:24.749
SAM: Who do they fit?

00:27:24.749 --> 00:27:29.953
MATT: They fit anyone who wishes to put them on.
Magical items alter themselves.

00:27:29.953 --> 00:27:31.668
MARISHA: Oh, we're playing with that later.

00:27:31.668 --> 00:27:33.590
TRAVIS: I'll just hang onto it. I'll just hold
onto it.

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:38.828
MARISHA: Can we all just try them once when we get
back to Greyskull Keep?

00:27:38.828 --> 00:27:40.603
MATT: Anything else you want to do while you're
waiting?

00:27:40.603 --> 00:27:42.608
SAM: Anything else in the room? Can I sniff around
the room and investigate?

00:27:42.608 --> 00:27:44.284
MATT: Yeah, go ahead and make an investigation
check.

00:27:44.284 --> 00:27:46.164
TRAVIS: I drag Anders over to the fireplace.

00:27:46.164 --> 00:27:47.859
LIAM: I'll look with Scanlan.

00:27:47.859 --> 00:27:49.320
SAM: 12.

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.749
TRAVIS: He doesn't quite fit, so I have to snap
some joints.

00:27:51.749 --> 00:27:53.039
LIAM: 27.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:57.377
MATT: Okay, good. As you're looking through and
finding papers, papers and ledgers and tough

00:27:57.377 --> 00:28:04.357
discussions of old classes, untouched on the side,
you go through one of the bottom drawers, and

00:28:04.357 --> 00:28:05.559
there's a lock to it.

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:07.083
LIAM: Well, let's unlock that.

00:28:07.083 --> 00:28:09.421
SAM: Vax, do you need my help to unlock it?

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.869
LIAM: No, Shorty. Hold on. Are there any traps
in there?

00:28:11.869 --> 00:28:13.591
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:17.511
LIAM: Oh, that is 20.

00:28:17.511 --> 00:28:19.240
MATT: It does appear to be trapped.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.648
SAM: It does appear to be trapped?

00:28:20.648 --> 00:28:23.580
LIAM: So what do I roll to undo that? Dexterity?
Lockpick?

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.612
MATT: Thieves' tools, as well. So same check you
did.

00:28:27.612 --> 00:28:29.547
SAM: Oh, I can open it for you.

00:28:29.547 --> 00:28:31.824
LIAM: That's a natural 20, so that's untrapped.

00:28:31.824 --> 00:28:36.928
MATT: As part of that, you notice that this
mechanism is when it opens, if there isn't a

00:28:36.928 --> 00:28:43.243
switch underneath it held that's hidden, it will
cause a poison dart to launch out in the direction

00:28:43.243 --> 00:28:47.009
of whoever's in front of it. You hold the button,
you find it, you open it up without an issue, and

00:28:47.009 --> 00:28:51.795
you find the spring mechanism, snap it, and remove
the little poison-tipped bolt,

00:28:51.795 --> 00:28:52.941
and chuck it to the side.

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.446
LAURA: No, wait. Give me that. I take it.

00:28:54.446 --> 00:28:56.739
MATT: Okay. You have a poison-tipped bolt.

00:28:56.739 --> 00:28:57.688
LAURA: Okay.

00:28:57.688 --> 00:29:00.821
MATT: For a tiny little hand-crossbow is
essentially what it is.

00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:02.609
LIAM: So now I've got to unlock it, right?

00:29:02.609 --> 00:29:03.565
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:03.565 --> 00:29:05.111
LIAM: Yeah. Hey, 20.

00:29:05.111 --> 00:29:06.320
MATT: Natural 20?

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.585
LIAM: No, not a natural 20.

00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:11.114
MATT: Oh, okay. Easy enough to unlock at this
point, you get it open, you pull it open, there's

00:29:11.114 --> 00:29:13.340
a collection of letters.

00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:22.538
LIAM: Percival, come here. You're probably the
best person to know what to make of these.

00:29:22.538 --> 00:29:28.538
MATT: You glance through and inspect them, and you
take the next ten minutes or so to get the gist of

00:29:28.538 --> 00:29:36.942
these letters while Cassandra's away. Many of them
talk about a slew of things that are disconcerting

00:29:36.942 --> 00:29:42.850
to you as the information hits you, and you relay
this information to the group. Notes on the

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:52.284
removal of key magical defenses during the
political meeting at Emon. The discussion, as in

00:29:52.284 --> 00:29:58.028
making sure that certain individuals and
safeguards that are usually made during political

00:29:58.028 --> 00:30:02.567
meetings like that were not present during that
endeavor.

00:30:02.567 --> 00:30:04.386
LAURA: Evidence is what that is!

00:30:04.386 --> 00:30:11.306
MATT: Notes on best construction methods using the
mined whitestone and repairs for the manse in the

00:30:11.363 --> 00:30:12.468
ziggurat.

00:30:12.468 --> 00:30:13.768
MARISHA and TRAVIS: The manse?

00:30:13.768 --> 00:30:15.035
SAM: As in a mansion?

00:30:15.035 --> 00:30:25.543
MATT: A manse is a place or a home; it has many
different meanings. They're warning Anders, and

00:30:25.543 --> 00:30:28.569
there are multiple letters at different periods of
time over the past few years that are warning

00:30:28.612 --> 00:30:31.447
Anders of an arrival of Seeker Asum's spies.

00:30:31.447 --> 00:30:33.029
SAM: He's a good guy.

00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:34.020
LAURA: Oh!

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.236
SAM: No, he's a bad guy?

00:30:36.236 --> 00:30:41.641
MATT: There are letters talking about plotting,
diverting political attention away from Whitestone

00:30:41.641 --> 00:30:50.399
to leave it a political enigma during this period
of time. There are letters talking about planting

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:57.500
information within Wildmount that would lead their
investigation team to believe the Briarwoods had

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.700
been found dead.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.228
SAM: This is a whole paper trail!

00:31:01.228 --> 00:31:06.731
MATT: And occasionally there are mentions in a lot
of these letters that speak of, "The Undying King

00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:08.847
"shall return, we are his blood."

00:31:08.847 --> 00:31:11.777
MARISHA: Jarl? What?

00:31:11.777 --> 00:31:13.756
MATT: The Undying King shall return.

00:31:13.756 --> 00:31:15.237
LAURA: Where did she get Jarl from?

00:31:15.237 --> 00:31:16.285
MATT: We are his blood.

00:31:16.285 --> 00:31:17.398
LAURA: Oh, "we are."

00:31:17.398 --> 00:31:19.582
MARISHA: The Undying King...

00:31:19.582 --> 00:31:20.670
TALIESIN: Shall return.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:22.402
TALIESIN and SAM: We are his blood.

00:31:22.402 --> 00:31:23.927
MARISHA: Which is what he said.

00:31:23.927 --> 00:31:25.072
SAM: And then it says Jarl.

00:31:25.072 --> 00:31:27.173
TALIESIN: Jarl. Maybe he was dictating.

00:31:27.173 --> 00:31:28.697
MATT: The letters aren't signed.

00:31:28.697 --> 00:31:32.217
SAM: Okay? Are they all of the same hand?

00:31:32.217 --> 00:31:37.941
MATT: They are all of the same handwriting. In the
cluster, there is one completely unrelated letter

00:31:37.941 --> 00:31:42.893
that talks about business ledgers and construction
of the bridge. It appears to be a simple

00:31:42.893 --> 00:31:49.315
discussion on the future plans to construct the
bridge.

00:31:49.315 --> 00:31:50.532
SAM: Is that in the same hand?

00:31:50.532 --> 00:31:51.485
MATT: It is in the same handwriting.

00:31:51.485 --> 00:31:52.433
SAM: And is it signed?

00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:54.653
MATT: It is signed a Lord Riskel Daxio.

00:31:54.653 --> 00:31:57.354
MARISHA: What! Who? Axio?

00:31:57.354 --> 00:31:58.965
TRAVIS and SAM: Riskel Daxio.

00:31:58.965 --> 00:32:00.339
MATT: Riskel Daxio.

00:32:00.339 --> 00:32:01.745
LAURA and MARISHA: We know him!

00:32:01.745 --> 00:32:02.812
MATT: Yep.

00:32:02.812 --> 00:32:03.709
LAURA: Who is he?

00:32:03.709 --> 00:32:05.153
MATT: He's on the Council of Tal'Dorei.

00:32:05.153 --> 00:32:09.044
LAURA: (gasps) Oh, motherfucker! He's a spy.

00:32:09.044 --> 00:32:10.452
MARISHA: He's our fucking spy!

00:32:10.452 --> 00:32:15.074
MATT: He's technically also the one that helped
designate the construction of your keep and

00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:16.326
plotted the construction stuff--

00:32:16.326 --> 00:32:17.396
LAURA: Oh no.

00:32:17.396 --> 00:32:18.458
SAM: He built our keep!

00:32:18.458 --> 00:32:20.157
MARISHA: He's the construction guy, he's like our
head builder.

00:32:20.157 --> 00:32:22.754
LIAM: He could be spying on us around the keep.

00:32:22.754 --> 00:32:29.491
TALIESIN: He could have a secret entrance to our
Keep that he built and didn't tell us.

00:32:29.491 --> 00:32:30.860
LAURA: Holy moly.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:34.768
SAM: As soon as I see that, I go down in a crouch
and I shit-scry on our keep to

00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:36.620
see if it's still there.

00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.963
MARISHA: Oh my god, that's right, you did that!
And I put an elemental there. It's babysitting.

00:32:41.963 --> 00:32:43.506
MATT: Yes, you did.

00:32:43.506 --> 00:32:46.917
MARISHA: Hopefully still there. 30 days.

00:32:46.917 --> 00:32:54.186
MATT: 30 days. Glancing within the kitchen, there
doesn't appear to be much that catches your

00:32:54.186 --> 00:32:54.963
attention.

00:32:54.963 --> 00:32:56.210
TALIESIN: You shat in the kitchen?

00:32:56.210 --> 00:33:00.572
SAM: I put a mound of shit in a jar in the kitchen
and I told them, don't clean it up.

00:33:00.572 --> 00:33:03.111
MATT: Like you do.

00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:04.591
SAM: You know.

00:33:04.591 --> 00:33:05.507
LAURA: Like you do.

00:33:05.507 --> 00:33:06.999
SAM: Thursdays.

00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:11.475
TRAVIS: I've got Anders in the fireplace, and I
light the Firebrand War Hammer with the magic

00:33:11.475 --> 00:33:14.192
word, bacon, and I hit it and set him on fire.

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:19.068
MATT: There was already a fire in the fireplace,
but you just stoke it a little further, and pretty

00:33:19.068 --> 00:33:22.252
soon the delicious scent of burning human flesh
fills the room.

00:33:22.252 --> 00:33:23.280
LAURA: Bacon?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.931
TRAVIS: Yeah, bacon. Did you not know that's what
the word was?

00:33:26.931 --> 00:33:28.929
SAM: So everything's fine at the keep?

00:33:28.929 --> 00:33:30.362
MATT: At the time.

00:33:30.362 --> 00:33:31.970
SAM: At the time, okay.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.251
MATT: At least, there's nothing on fire, there's
no screams, there's no movement. It just seems

00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:36.903
like the cold kitchen is untouched.

00:33:36.903 --> 00:33:41.270
SAM: Guys, my shit saw no movement.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:43.408
(laughter)

00:33:43.408 --> 00:33:46.267
LAURA: Good to know, Scanlan.

00:33:46.267 --> 00:33:49.611
TALIESIN: You've squeezed all you're going to be
able to get out of that.

00:33:49.611 --> 00:33:57.302
TRAVIS: Percy. Can we get into the underground
caverns from here?

00:33:57.302 --> 00:34:02.635
TALIESIN: Can I think of a way? I'm assuming I
know a way to where this might be.

00:34:02.635 --> 00:34:09.595
MATT: As you have this conversation, a voice from
the doorway rings out. "I can take you." You look

00:34:09.595 --> 00:34:10.981
over, and it's Cassandra.

00:34:10.981 --> 00:34:12.248
TALIESIN: She's going to take us.

00:34:12.248 --> 00:34:13.374
SAM: Is that your sister?

00:34:13.374 --> 00:34:14.298
TALIESIN: Apparently.

00:34:14.298 --> 00:34:19.905
MATT: She's currently now dressed in armor you've
seen as ornamental before. It was armor that your

00:34:19.905 --> 00:34:25.607
mother trained in when she was young, but was
unused for a long time. It seems to be

00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:31.297
serviceable; it's been updated and such. She
slides a shortsword into a sheath at her side, and

00:34:31.297 --> 00:34:36.674
her hair is pulled back and tied off, and she
looks at the rest of the room. "So are we ready?"

00:34:36.674 --> 00:34:38.586
TRAVIS: Let me see your neck.

00:34:38.586 --> 00:34:42.538
MATT: She steps up and lifts her chin up towards
you.

00:34:42.538 --> 00:34:43.888
SAM: By the way, this is Grog.

00:34:43.888 --> 00:34:45.412
LIAM: I'm going to insight check as he does that.

00:34:45.412 --> 00:34:47.093
TALIESIN: These are my friends, by the way.

00:34:47.093 --> 00:34:49.908
TRAVIS: Do I see anything on her neck?

00:34:49.908 --> 00:34:54.833
MATT: No. It seems fine. There's no signs of any
puncture wounds. Rolling?

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:55.892
LIAM: It's a 15.

00:34:55.892 --> 00:35:01.188
MATT: Okay. She seems as determined as the rest of
you.

00:35:01.188 --> 00:35:04.414
LAURA: All right.

00:35:04.414 --> 00:35:07.620
TALIESIN: Lead the way, sister.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.915
MATT: She turns around and she begins walking back
down the hallway.

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:16.823
LAURA: Can we expect any more traps that you're
aware of?

00:35:16.823 --> 00:35:22.402
MATT: "That I'm aware of, no, but I'm certain that
there may be. They know you're coming, it seems.

00:35:22.402 --> 00:35:26.063
"So be wary. Be careful. I'll take you to the
undercroft."

00:35:26.063 --> 00:35:27.836
LIAM: Did we just have a short rest here?

00:35:27.836 --> 00:35:28.777
MATT: You did.

00:35:28.777 --> 00:35:30.379
LIAM: Going to heal up.

00:35:30.379 --> 00:35:43.068
SAM: Hey, Percival. Any chance you can load up one
of Ripley's guns for me?

00:35:43.068 --> 00:35:50.191
TALIESIN: I don't know if it will actually-- I
would have to probably train you in

00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:51.431
how to use it.

00:35:51.431 --> 00:35:57.414
SAM: Really? I've seen you use it. You just pull
your finger on the finger part and the big boom

00:35:57.414 --> 00:35:58.727
part goes out.

00:35:58.727 --> 00:36:01.399
TALIESIN: It's a little more complicated than
that, actually.

00:36:01.399 --> 00:36:03.812
SAM: Well, you have to point it at the thing you
want to be boomed.

00:36:03.812 --> 00:36:07.400
MATT: He could use it, he just wouldn't be able to
add his proficiency bonus to the attack rolls.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:13.652
TALIESIN: I'll load one for you. I'll give him
her boomstick.

00:36:13.652 --> 00:36:16.375
MATT: Okay. You take it. You inspect it as you
guys are walking along.

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:18.227
TALIESIN: Just making sure it functions, too.

00:36:18.227 --> 00:36:22.465
MATT: It seems pretty functional. It's
well-constructed, it's sleek. Your Pepperbox has a

00:36:22.465 --> 00:36:27.807
bit of flair to its design, this is your
background. Hers is just streamlined, simple, much

00:36:27.807 --> 00:36:32.791
like the decor of her room when you saw it. She
doesn't mess with anything fancy or unnecessary.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:39.860
The ammunition she does have are made specific to
size to her pistol. They will not function for the

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.450
Pepperbox, unfortunately. They will only work for
the pistol.

00:36:43.450 --> 00:36:45.956
TALIESIN: Doing okay. Not doing great, but I'm
doing okay.

00:36:45.956 --> 00:36:51.906
MATT: It does act as a pistol for rules-wise,
which is on your sheet here, so yes, you would

00:36:51.906 --> 00:36:53.027
have that.

00:36:53.027 --> 00:36:55.061
LAURA: Do you want it? Just in case yours
misfires?

00:36:55.061 --> 00:36:57.628
TALIESIN: I'll steal it back from him if I need,
but it should be fine.

00:36:57.628 --> 00:37:04.935
SAM: I'd like to make an athletics check.
Athletics. See if I can spin it around and put it

00:37:04.935 --> 00:37:06.263
in my pocket.

00:37:06.263 --> 00:37:08.782
LAURA: Wait, where did you get it? I had it in my
belt.

00:37:08.782 --> 00:37:10.133
TALIESIN: No, if you have it.

00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:11.026
LAURA: I have it.

00:37:11.026 --> 00:37:12.031
SAM: Okay, give it to me.

00:37:12.031 --> 00:37:13.106
TALIESIN: Give it to him.

00:37:13.106 --> 00:37:14.759
MARISHA: Put your eye out.

00:37:14.759 --> 00:37:18.000
MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll dexterity, roll
a d20, add your dexterity modifier.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.313
LIAM: Don't roll a one.

00:37:19.313 --> 00:37:23.275
TALIESIN: This is literally how she lost her
hand.

00:37:23.275 --> 00:37:26.770
SAM: Wait, what's this? Why does it say plus
four?

00:37:26.770 --> 00:37:28.884
LAURA: This music is awful as you're checking.

00:37:28.884 --> 00:37:30.926
MARISHA: Yeah, the violins plinking.

00:37:30.926 --> 00:37:34.482
SAM: Well, it's zero, but it says a big plus four
next to it for some reason.

00:37:34.595 --> 00:37:39.178
MATT: I don't know. Add zero. What did you roll?

00:37:39.178 --> 00:37:40.445
SAM: It was 14.

00:37:40.445 --> 00:37:45.779
MATT: Okay. You manage to get it in there.
Thankfully it's not loaded, because you feel the

00:37:45.779 --> 00:37:49.514
trigger go off. But there wasn't a bullet loaded,
so it's like (click).

00:37:49.514 --> 00:37:51.050
TRAVIS: Yeah, we took out the ammunition.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.666
SAM: Okay, now give me a bullet.

00:37:52.666 --> 00:37:56.732
TRAVIS: Maybe don't do that.

00:37:56.732 --> 00:38:01.555
TALIESIN: I hand him the ammunition. I load four
of them.

00:38:01.555 --> 00:38:02.835
SAM: Yeah!

00:38:02.835 --> 00:38:04.839
LAURA: Giving him a loaded gun?

00:38:04.839 --> 00:38:07.243
SAM: I'm a big boy. Well, I'm a little boy. But
I'm a little big boy.

00:38:07.243 --> 00:38:10.758
LIAM: I would like to walk past Scanlan and grab
it out of his hand.

00:38:10.758 --> 00:38:13.104
SAM: I will prevent him from doing that!

00:38:13.104 --> 00:38:14.109
MATT: Okay.

00:38:14.109 --> 00:38:16.527
MARISHA: You guys are fighting over a loaded gun.

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:18.756
MATT: Sleight-of-hand check. Athletics check.

00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:23.985
LIAM: You go first.

00:38:23.985 --> 00:38:26.055
SAM: Is this a skill check?

00:38:26.055 --> 00:38:28.245
MATT: Yeah. Add your athletics to your roll.

00:38:28.245 --> 00:38:29.472
SAM: 17!

00:38:29.472 --> 00:38:31.440
LIAM: Shut up. 27.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:35.941
MATT: As you go to be, "No, what are you--" It's
already gone. You don't even know where it went,

00:38:35.941 --> 00:38:38.487
you didn't see him take it, you just all of a
sudden see it in his hand as he walks past you.

00:38:38.487 --> 00:38:43.667
LIAM: And I walk over to Cassandra. I don't give
her the gun, I just say, you're Cassandra?

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:44.608
MATT: "Yes."

00:38:44.608 --> 00:38:50.488
LIAM: I was at the door. He had a knife to your
throat. He wanted you to say something to us. What

00:38:50.488 --> 00:38:51.815
did he want you to say?

00:38:51.815 --> 00:38:57.021
MATT: "He wanted me to shout for help. He wanted
me to draw you in."

00:38:57.021 --> 00:38:59.892
LAURA: Can I insight check her to see if she's
telling the truth?

00:38:59.892 --> 00:39:00.860
MATT: Yeah.

00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:07.020
LIAM: You've been living here. How did it come
that he had a blade to your throat today? How did

00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:08.886
it all unravel? Have you been living here?

00:39:08.886 --> 00:39:09.954
LAURA: 24.

00:39:09.954 --> 00:39:11.934
MATT: 24. She's telling the truth.

00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:13.644
LAURA: Okay. That's good.

00:39:13.644 --> 00:39:23.418
MATT: "Well, after the arrows felled me-- I guess
I should start at the beginning." And she's

00:39:23.418 --> 00:39:27.504
walking along with you guys as she's leading you
down the stairs and down to the bottom floor. She

00:39:27.504 --> 00:39:30.436
doesn't look to you. She's still looking ahead,
very intent.

00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:32.980
LAURA: I take that pistol back from you.

00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:41.369
MATT: "After the arrows felled me, I recovered.
Father Reynal found me. Brought me from the brink

00:39:41.369 --> 00:39:51.051
"at the temple of Pelor outside of town. Things
hadn't fallen quite that far back then. We had

00:39:51.051 --> 00:39:58.720
"more people in the city. At the time, the
Briarwood rule was fresh and folks were eager to

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.931
"speak out against what they had wrought on this
city, the fall of the de Rolos.

00:40:02.931 --> 00:40:07.252
"We still thought they had fallen to plague, but
through some unfortunate political business, they

00:40:07.252 --> 00:40:13.322
"had come to power, but we began to question it. I
knew better. I told the truth once I'd recovered.

00:40:13.322 --> 00:40:22.932
"We began to build our first rebellion. Two years
we built up the resistance before we made our

00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:32.886
"first move. They seemed to know exactly what we
were plotting. Cut us off at every angle.

00:40:33.009 --> 00:40:43.480
"Couldn't see who it was who was giving up our
information, but I knew it was close. But before I

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:51.563
"had the opportunity, I was helming a group that
was traveling to utilize the escape route that I

00:40:51.606 --> 00:41:00.672
"took you through when they first attacked. It was
just after dusk, and Lord Briarwood was there

00:41:00.672 --> 00:41:13.539
"waiting for us in the forest. He slaughtered most
of the men, but he recognized my face from the

00:41:13.539 --> 00:41:17.808
"dinner we had the night they took the castle.

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:33.155
"They did not harm me, strangely. They treated me
like a guest against my will, in my own house. I

00:41:33.155 --> 00:41:40.648
"seemed to ascertain that by keeping me there,
having a member of the house within their grasp,

00:41:40.648 --> 00:41:42.810
"they could use that as leverage. I don't know.

00:41:42.856 --> 00:41:50.517
"Sylas, he had his charms, and there were many
that worked beneath them against their own will.

00:41:50.517 --> 00:42:03.932
"It did not work on me. My hatred was too strong.
So instead, they tried to provide me with wealth.

00:42:03.932 --> 00:42:15.272
"Power, here in Whitestone. I just took to reading
and ignoring it all. I don't know why they kept me

00:42:15.272 --> 00:42:21.650
"around, but I wasn't going to question it if it
gave me a chance to possibly undermine them."

00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:28.159
She grabs the side of her sword as you guys have
now reached now down the long hallway towards the

00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:32.407
back of the castle. You know the direction she's
taking you. It leads to the cellar, to the

00:42:32.407 --> 00:42:35.546
undercroft and the de Rolo mausoleum.

00:42:35.546 --> 00:42:49.329
"Three years of reading in that library. Father's
library. Strategy. Tactics. Old lines of

00:42:49.329 --> 00:42:58.620
"information, as well as the myths and history of
Whitestone. I found allies within the castle. I

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:03.770
"contacted Yennen, and through him, Archibald, who
helped me build the first rebellion.

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:14.743
"Archibald still lives, Percy. He's been
completely necessary for what we've built here."

00:43:14.743 --> 00:43:23.747
She looks down at her armor as you guys reach the
edge of the cellar, and she pulls the door open

00:43:23.747 --> 00:43:33.993
quietly. There's wooden stairs that lead down into
the cellar. She taps her armor. "This was

00:43:33.993 --> 00:43:39.443
"Mother's. It's good to know I'm not the only
tomboy in the bloodline." Brushes the hair out of

00:43:39.443 --> 00:43:42.939
her face, and for the first time really looks at
you with a smile since she first saw you.

00:43:42.939 --> 00:44:00.620
TALIESIN: (sighs) Can we do one thing before we go
down into the cellar? This is the best day of my

00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:06.995
life, and I can't help but be suspicious.

00:44:06.995 --> 00:44:09.789
MATT: "I completely understand."

00:44:09.789 --> 00:44:18.918
TALIESIN: Is there any way to check if she's being
controlled?

00:44:18.918 --> 00:44:21.323
TRAVIS: I was thinking the same thing.

00:44:21.323 --> 00:44:22.978
TALIESIN: Can we put your helmet on her?

00:44:22.978 --> 00:44:31.102
MATT: The only thing you really have seen work is
the Greater Restoration spell you cast on Seeker

00:44:31.144 --> 00:44:36.818
Asum when you guys were with the Council of
Tal'Dorei. That did seem to remove any sort of

00:44:36.818 --> 00:44:38.527
charm effects, if that's what you're asking.

00:44:38.527 --> 00:44:39.996
LAURA: We don't have that?

00:44:39.996 --> 00:44:47.521
MARISHA: I didn't learn it. Not for today. I
thought Pike's magic would hold up.

00:44:47.521 --> 00:44:50.092
TRAVIS: I can try and jog her memory.

00:44:50.092 --> 00:44:54.561
MATT: "What can I do to make you trust me?"

00:44:54.561 --> 00:44:55.884
SAM: Punch her in the face?

00:44:55.884 --> 00:44:58.576
TALIESIN: I do trust you. That's the problem.

00:44:58.576 --> 00:45:03.112
MATT: She smiles a little. "Whatever you need."

00:45:03.112 --> 00:45:10.240
TALIESIN: I've got nothing. (sighs)

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:18.653
MATT: Does anyone have any creative means with
which they would want to check?

00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:21.624
TALIESIN: What would happen if we put your helmet
on her?

00:45:21.624 --> 00:45:24.689
MARISHA: If she's already controlled--

00:45:24.689 --> 00:45:26.784
TALIESIN: This would disrupt it, maybe.

00:45:26.784 --> 00:45:30.359
MARISHA: We could try it. It doesn't hurt to put a
hat on.

00:45:30.359 --> 00:45:33.077
LAURA: It has to be attuned over a short rest,
though.

00:45:33.077 --> 00:45:34.270
MARISHA: It does.

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.464
TALIESIN: Does the hat need to be attuned over a
short rest?

00:45:36.464 --> 00:45:37.762
MATT: In theory.

00:45:37.762 --> 00:45:45.840
LIAM: I want to suggest something to you. We rest
here for a half hour, and I give this to you. This

00:45:45.840 --> 00:46:01.841
came from a very strange creature. It will help
you resist any control, if there is any control,

00:46:01.887 --> 00:46:10.271
and one of us-- you could even choose-- could
strike you and try to take you out of it, and if

00:46:10.271 --> 00:46:14.860
you are not being controlled, then you are being
struck across the face, and I'm sorry for that,

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:22.765
but if you are, there's a possibility we'd pull
you out. I know that would hurt, but it would go a

00:46:22.765 --> 00:46:24.799
long way to earn our trust.

00:46:24.799 --> 00:46:33.348
MATT: "If that's what it takes." She takes it from
your hand and inspects it for a second. "Shoddy

00:46:33.348 --> 00:46:38.375
"craftsmanship." Places it on her head, and it's a
little big at first,

00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:40.319
then it conforms to her head.

00:46:40.319 --> 00:46:42.833
LIAM: Your choice.

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:48.577
MATT: She sits down a couple of steps deeper into
the cellar. Curls around a corner; ushers you all

00:46:48.577 --> 00:46:50.124
over into the shadows.

00:46:50.124 --> 00:46:52.376
MARISHA: Can I see, before we leave, are we near
any windows?

00:46:52.376 --> 00:47:01.940
MATT: From this location? No. All the windows that
would be here would face out into the north side

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.288
of Whitestone, which is forested.

00:47:03.288 --> 00:47:04.354
MARISHA: Backyard?

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:06.987
MATT: You guys are on the north side of the castle
now. The city is south from you.

00:47:06.987 --> 00:47:08.446
MARISHA: All right.

00:47:08.446 --> 00:47:17.131
MATT: So you take a moment and sit. While you guys
are waiting, she takes a moment. She's adjusting

00:47:17.131 --> 00:47:24.563
it and feeling it and inspecting her hands.
(sighs) "I don't feel any different.

00:47:24.598 --> 00:47:26.297
"While we wait--"

00:47:26.297 --> 00:47:28.744
LIAM: What if the little one struck you?

00:47:28.784 --> 00:47:30.838
SAM: Struck her?

00:47:30.838 --> 00:47:33.263
LAURA: Give it some time.

00:47:33.263 --> 00:47:36.356
MATT: She gives a wry grin. "Whatever you
choose."

00:47:36.356 --> 00:47:40.136
SAM: I could try to tell if she's evil or not.
Would that help?

00:47:40.136 --> 00:47:41.077
LAURA: Yeah.

00:47:41.077 --> 00:47:45.590
LIAM: I don't know. I don't think she's evil. She
could be a puppet.

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:56.726
MARISHA: Can I try this? This is a long shot. My--
actually, our fey ancestry, from being half-elves.

00:47:56.726 --> 00:48:03.456
We're immune to charm effects. Or we have
resistance.

00:48:03.456 --> 00:48:04.856
LIAM: Resistant to it.

00:48:04.856 --> 00:48:14.386
MARISHA: Advantage against saves. Since we have
that, can we use our fey ancestry, the three of

00:48:14.386 --> 00:48:18.005
us, to tap into her and see if we can detect a
charm?

00:48:18.005 --> 00:48:22.750
MATT: Your resistance doesn't make you attuned to
it. Unfortunately, it's just a natural ability

00:48:22.750 --> 00:48:27.828
that's inherent. Her being human, there's not a
way to really correlate with that. I mean, you've

00:48:27.828 --> 00:48:30.486
read over her a few times, doing insight checks.

00:48:30.486 --> 00:48:32.446
TALIESIN: Wait, it was Greater Restoration?

00:48:32.446 --> 00:48:33.347
MARISHA and LAURA: Yeah.

00:48:33.347 --> 00:48:34.466
TALIESIN: Ah!

00:48:34.466 --> 00:48:37.906
SAM: You have that?

00:48:37.906 --> 00:48:41.623
TALIESIN: I have a potion. This should solve all
of our problems.

00:48:41.623 --> 00:48:44.465
SAM: Or you could save that for when one of us
becomes a vampire.

00:48:44.465 --> 00:48:49.998
TALIESIN: No, it will be-- And I'm pulling out a
potion bottle. This is if you are controlled.

00:48:49.998 --> 00:48:51.980
This could fix it.

00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:57.336
MATT: She puts her hand out. Her leather glove's
pulled over it now. You've never seen her militant

00:48:57.336 --> 00:49:00.559
before, and it's a really interesting visual to
you.

00:49:00.559 --> 00:49:02.132
TALIESIN: I look at her.

00:49:02.132 --> 00:49:16.930
MATT: She drinks the potion. Whole thing down.
(coughs)

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:19.575
TALIESIN: That was actually a minor healing
potion. I was just seeing if you did it

00:49:19.575 --> 00:49:20.747
intentionally.

00:49:20.747 --> 00:49:22.970
(laughter)

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:27.502
MATT: She gives a wry grin and wipes her mouth. "I
thought I recognized that terrible earthy taste."

00:49:27.502 --> 00:49:30.008
She tosses the crystal decanter to you.

00:49:30.008 --> 00:49:31.521
LIAM: Clever boy.

00:49:31.521 --> 00:49:35.102
MATT: "Huh. You always were the clever one."

00:49:35.102 --> 00:49:41.987
TALIESIN: I figured it was worth a shot. Best
we're going to do.

00:49:41.987 --> 00:49:43.775
SAM: Am I supposed to punch her in the face now?

00:49:43.775 --> 00:49:44.750
LIAM: No.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:46.933
MATT: "Do you need this thing?"

00:49:46.933 --> 00:49:48.234
LIAM: I'll take it back, yeah.

00:49:48.234 --> 00:49:49.449
MATT: She hands it back to you.

00:49:49.449 --> 00:49:51.214
TALIESIN: All right.

00:49:51.214 --> 00:50:00.148
MATT: There's a fascination she has with her
armor. "I've not been able to wear this before. It

00:50:00.148 --> 00:50:02.721
"feels good to have something close to Mother."

00:50:02.721 --> 00:50:05.977
TALIESIN: It's been a long time. (sighs)

00:50:05.977 --> 00:50:13.259
MATT: "Simon repaired it for me when he was
working here. I haven't seen him in a while. I'm

00:50:13.259 --> 00:50:14.655
"worried."

00:50:14.655 --> 00:50:18.656
TALIESIN: Let's go down and take care of this.
Cass?

00:50:18.656 --> 00:50:22.592
MATT: She leads you down through the cellar--

00:50:22.592 --> 00:50:26.996
MARISHA: Wait, hang on. Before we enter: it's safe
to assume they know we're coming, correct?

00:50:26.996 --> 00:50:27.955
SAM: If they're there.

00:50:27.955 --> 00:50:29.293
LAURA: Yeah.

00:50:29.293 --> 00:50:30.155
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:50:30.155 --> 00:50:32.730
LIAM: Better safe than sorry.

00:50:32.730 --> 00:50:38.880
SAM: Can I ask Cassandra--

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.314
MATT: You can ask her anything you'd like.

00:50:41.314 --> 00:50:45.647
SAM: Are the Briarwoods going to be down there?
Are they here?

00:50:45.647 --> 00:50:50.210
MATT: She goes, "I have no confirmation of it, but
they spend most of their time down here. They're

00:50:50.210 --> 00:50:51.608
"preparing for something."

00:50:51.608 --> 00:50:53.236
LIAM: Have you ever been down here?

00:50:53.236 --> 00:50:58.341
MATT: "I'm not allowed down here, by their orders,
but I've snuck down a few times out of curiosity.

00:50:58.341 --> 00:51:06.196
"I've only gotten so far before I had to return,
but I've made it through the undercroft, through

00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:12.413
"most of the tunnels, and I've gotten to the
distillery, and that's about as far as I've

00:51:12.413 --> 00:51:17.250
"gotten. But I've followed them down here, and they
usually come with a group of guards,

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.741
"four or five strong."

00:51:19.741 --> 00:51:22.415
LAURA: All right.

00:51:22.415 --> 00:51:26.045
TRAVIS: Are there sentries? Can we expect to find
traps, lookouts?

00:51:26.045 --> 00:51:30.874
MATT: "It's definitely a possibility, so move
quietly. Be careful."

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.453
LAURA: What is Lady Briarwood?

00:51:33.453 --> 00:51:41.540
MATT: "What is Lady Briarwood? She's a wicked
beast of a creature, is what she is. I'd use less

00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:44.062
"savory words, but my brother's here."

00:51:44.062 --> 00:51:47.050
TALIESIN: There's a first time for everything, I
suppose.

00:51:47.050 --> 00:51:56.483
MATT: As she leads you guys down the stairs
towards the undercroft, she goes, "She's not like

00:51:56.483 --> 00:52:07.609
"her husband. That I know. As far as I can tell,
she's human, but she has a very powerful control

00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:13.911
"over life and death. She's a practitioner of the
arcane, definitely, but her focus seems to be

00:52:13.911 --> 00:52:23.520
"necromancy on a wide scale. And while Delilah and
Sylas are man and wife, they speak of another."

00:52:23.556 --> 00:52:26.787
SAM: They speak of another?

00:52:26.787 --> 00:52:29.116
LAURA: The guy that they're trying to bring back.

00:52:29.116 --> 00:52:31.739
MATT: "It's as if a third party completes their
union."

00:52:31.783 --> 00:52:34.365
SAM: Oh, this is the king that will rise again?

00:52:34.365 --> 00:52:40.694
MATT: "They don't say any names. They refer to him
as 'him' or 'The Whispered One.' No reference

00:52:40.694 --> 00:52:41.882
"beyond that."

00:52:41.882 --> 00:52:43.081
LAURA: (gasps)

00:52:43.081 --> 00:52:44.199
SAM: What?

00:52:44.199 --> 00:52:46.209
LAURA: (whispering) What if it's the guy in
Percy?

00:52:46.209 --> 00:52:47.041
SAM: What if it's what?

00:52:47.041 --> 00:52:48.276
TALIESIN: I'm having that thought, as well.

00:52:48.276 --> 00:52:49.847
LAURA: Percy's smoke monster.

00:52:49.847 --> 00:52:50.989
SAM: Oh shit.

00:52:50.989 --> 00:52:52.013
MARISHA: Oh boy.

00:52:52.013 --> 00:52:55.914
LIAM: He's playing both sides, possibly,
Percival.

00:52:55.914 --> 00:53:02.878
SAM: Oh, another question for Cassandra. The duke,
Negmeyer? Vegmeyer? Venkman?

00:53:02.878 --> 00:53:04.511
TALIESIN and MARISHA: Quagmire.

00:53:04.511 --> 00:53:06.865
MATT: "Vedmeyer, yes."

00:53:06.907 --> 00:53:10.449
SAM: Vedmeyer. Have you seen him around the castle
today, or recently?

00:53:10.449 --> 00:53:13.357
MATT: "I've only seen him in the castle maybe
three times since we've been here."

00:53:13.357 --> 00:53:16.860
SAM: Because Grog? He's a goliath.

00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:18.320
TRAVIS: He's-- wait, what?

00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.394
SAM: He's a big goliath, so if he's here, you
should just, you know--

00:53:23.394 --> 00:53:24.759
TRAVIS: How did you see him?

00:53:24.759 --> 00:53:30.131
SAM: Oh, when I was a dinosaur and I burned down a
house and killed a bunch of people...

00:53:30.131 --> 00:53:33.949
TALIESIN: That's a series of words that I know
individually, but he strings them together in ways

00:53:33.949 --> 00:53:35.271
that don't make any sense.

00:53:35.271 --> 00:53:38.910
SAM: I wouldn't say fought, because I beat him
really easily, and then I ran away.

00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:40.174
TRAVIS: Oh, you killed him?

00:53:40.174 --> 00:53:46.267
SAM: No, I just pushed him off a building, then I
thought that was enough for the day,

00:53:46.267 --> 00:53:47.579
so I went home.

00:53:47.579 --> 00:53:54.238
MATT: Cassandra looks over her shoulder at this.
"It's a shame you're not as tall as your tales,

00:53:54.238 --> 00:53:55.291
"small one."

00:53:55.291 --> 00:53:58.928
SAM: Well, thank you. I'll take that as a
compliment.

00:53:58.928 --> 00:54:00.195
TALIESIN: No!

00:54:00.195 --> 00:54:01.714
SAM: Don't worry.

00:54:01.714 --> 00:54:03.442
MARISHA: (laughing) No.

00:54:03.442 --> 00:54:05.306
(laughter)

00:54:05.306 --> 00:54:09.721
SAM: Before we cross the precipice into this--
what is it, undercroft?

00:54:09.721 --> 00:54:11.381
MATT: Undercroft she was referring to, yes.

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:18.757
SAM: Percival, we all have fought with you this
whole time, and you know that we have your back

00:54:18.757 --> 00:54:23.683
and that we're with you in this 100 percent. But
I'd like our enemies to know that, as well, so

00:54:23.683 --> 00:54:29.864
with your permission, I will cast Seeming on all
of us. And I make the girls look like Cassandra,

00:54:29.864 --> 00:54:34.999
and the boys look like Percy. So I give us all the
gray hair.

00:54:34.999 --> 00:54:37.691
TALIESIN: You crazy motherfucker!

00:54:37.691 --> 00:54:44.611
SAM: And if possible, I'd like to emblazon the
sign of the rebellion on our chests in sort of an

00:54:44.611 --> 00:54:47.231
awesome Superman glowing thing.

00:54:47.231 --> 00:54:59.841
MATT: With a flicker of Scanlan's arcane mastery,
all of you form into a small battalion of Percys

00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:01.144
and Cassandras.

00:55:01.144 --> 00:55:02.574
LIAM: Is he a big Percy?

00:55:02.574 --> 00:55:08.406
MATT: He would have to be, yeah, because he still
stays similar to his actual size, so if Percy was

00:55:08.406 --> 00:55:10.012
a little thicker and a little taller--

00:55:10.012 --> 00:55:11.175
MARISHA: Percy's been hitting the 'roids.

00:55:11.175 --> 00:55:12.186
MATT: Yep.

00:55:12.186 --> 00:55:14.303
LAURA: What is Trinket?

00:55:14.303 --> 00:55:17.606
SAM: A bear with two streaks of white hair.

00:55:17.606 --> 00:55:19.127
(all laugh)

00:55:19.127 --> 00:55:21.831
LAURA: And he's wearing little circle glasses.

00:55:21.831 --> 00:55:26.117
SAM: Yeah, with the little glasses. We are all de
Rolos today.

00:55:26.117 --> 00:55:27.565
MARISHA: He's a Hello Trinket!

00:55:27.565 --> 00:55:29.413
TALIESIN: Hello Trinket?

00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:30.436
MARISHA: Hello Trinket.

00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:40.616
MATT: Cassandra looks around very confused for a
second. "Curious, yes."

00:55:40.616 --> 00:55:45.881
MARISHA: But abrasive. Right? You're put off by
it, so it works. It's working.

00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:47.118
SAM: Possibly confused.

00:55:47.118 --> 00:55:49.369
TALIESIN: Abrasiveness is his most powerful
weapon.

00:55:49.369 --> 00:55:57.484
MATT: "So I'm beginning to see. Well, then." She
pulls her shortsword out. "Shall we?"

00:55:57.484 --> 00:56:00.013
LAURA: Are we going in to fight now?

00:56:00.013 --> 00:56:01.651
TRAVIS: We're going into the cavern.

00:56:01.651 --> 00:56:02.840
LAURA: I'm stealthing.

00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:06.903
MATT: "As are we all." Everyone roll stealth
checks.

00:56:06.903 --> 00:56:11.149
LAURA: Should I cast Pass Without a Trace? Yeah,
I'm going to use Pass Without a Trace, because I

00:56:11.149 --> 00:56:12.764
don't have a lot of 2nd-level spells.

00:56:12.764 --> 00:56:13.767
MATT: Okay.

00:56:13.767 --> 00:56:15.024
TALIESIN: Oh yeah. Please.

00:56:15.024 --> 00:56:15.878
MATT: Plus ten.

00:56:15.878 --> 00:56:17.076
LAURA: Yeah, plus ten to your stealth.

00:56:17.076 --> 00:56:17.877
SAM: Oh, really?

00:56:17.877 --> 00:56:18.661
LAURA: Yeah.

00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:19.421
TALIESIN: Thank god.

00:56:19.421 --> 00:56:20.125
TRAVIS: Boom!

00:56:20.125 --> 00:56:21.196
LAURA: Natural 20!

00:56:21.196 --> 00:56:22.231
LIAM: You're welcome.

00:56:22.231 --> 00:56:24.870
TRAVIS: 26. Natural 20.

00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:26.601
LIAM: 30. Natural 20.

00:56:26.601 --> 00:56:29.405
LAURA: Oh, natural 20.

00:56:29.405 --> 00:56:31.065
MATT: 30, plus whatever your bonus is.

00:56:31.065 --> 00:56:32.849
LIAM: That's with the bonus.

00:56:32.849 --> 00:56:35.303
MATT: I thought you rolled a natural 20?

00:56:35.303 --> 00:56:36.700
LAURA: That's 29, that's 39.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.916
MATT: Oh, you?

00:56:37.916 --> 00:56:39.229
LAURA: 39 for me.

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:40.894
MATT: 39? Your sister just out-stealthed you.

00:56:40.894 --> 00:56:42.349
LIAM: I gave her my fucking cloak, Matt.

00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:44.287
SAM: Do we all get plus ten?

00:56:44.287 --> 00:56:45.162
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:56:45.162 --> 00:56:46.235
SAM: Oh, then 29.

00:56:46.235 --> 00:56:47.459
MARISHA: 28.

00:56:47.459 --> 00:56:48.521
TALIESIN: 21.

00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:52.129
MATT: You all (whoosh) vanish.

00:56:52.129 --> 00:56:55.461
MARISHA: Before we go in, I go, Vax?

00:56:55.461 --> 00:56:58.335
LAURA: How do you know it's him?

00:56:58.335 --> 00:57:00.863
MATT: Solid point.

00:57:00.863 --> 00:57:01.984
MARISHA: Vax?

00:57:01.984 --> 00:57:03.600
SAM: Yes, it's me.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.646
TALIESIN: Yes, Keyleth?

00:57:04.646 --> 00:57:05.621
MARISHA: Vax?

00:57:05.621 --> 00:57:08.409
(laughter)

00:57:08.409 --> 00:57:17.623
SAM: Yes, it's me, Vax. What do you need? It's
me.

00:57:17.623 --> 00:57:19.051
LIAM: Kiki, I'm over here.

00:57:19.051 --> 00:57:20.571
MARISHA: Goddamn it, Scanlan!

00:57:20.571 --> 00:57:27.901
LAURA: This is really creepy because it's brother
and sister talking to each other right now. It

00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:29.966
looks like Percival and Cassandra.

00:57:29.966 --> 00:57:32.954
MATT: She's very uncomfortable right now, by the
way.

00:57:32.954 --> 00:57:36.725
TALIESIN: Is there anybody who is not made
uncomfortable by this?

00:57:36.725 --> 00:57:41.325
MARISHA: This was supposed to be a passing
comment, and it's turned into a thing. (laughs)

00:57:41.325 --> 00:57:49.877
Be careful.

00:57:49.877 --> 00:57:51.357
TALIESIN: Of course, Keyleth.

00:57:51.357 --> 00:57:52.408
LAURA: He will be.

00:57:52.408 --> 00:57:55.657
MARISHA: God damn it! I can't do this anymore.

00:57:55.657 --> 00:57:56.650
TALIESIN: Carry on.

00:57:56.650 --> 00:58:00.150
MARISHA: Just go. Let's go. Can we go?

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:04.486
SAM: Sister Vex? Do you mind giving me that gun
again?

00:58:04.524 --> 00:58:06.293
MARISHA: Shut up, Scanlan.

00:58:06.293 --> 00:58:08.188
TALIESIN: It will be no problem at all.

00:58:08.188 --> 00:58:09.689
LAURA: No, you can't have it.

00:58:09.689 --> 00:58:11.617
SAM: Why, because I'm three feet tall?

00:58:11.617 --> 00:58:13.352
LAURA: Because I want it.

00:58:13.352 --> 00:58:16.009
LIAM: (imitating Grog) Is this the body-switching
episode?

00:58:16.009 --> 00:58:19.669
TALIESIN: Right.

00:58:19.669 --> 00:58:20.843
SAM: Let's go.

00:58:20.843 --> 00:58:21.696
TALIESIN: Let's go.

00:58:21.696 --> 00:58:28.063
MATT: Continuing down, a long set of
whitestone-constructed stairs descend for about 45

00:58:28.063 --> 00:58:40.079
feet before they level off into the de Rolo
mausoleum. A long hallway continues forward that

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:48.194
contains two ten-by-ten stone structures that
contain the entombed bodies of previous

00:58:48.194 --> 00:58:54.325
generations of de Rolos, with six passages-- three
on each side-- that split off of this main hallway

00:58:54.325 --> 00:59:03.770
that contain their own stone-encapsulated corpses.
This is a place of silent prayer and showing

00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:09.356
appreciation for the previous families. Not all of
them are full, and there were extensions planned

00:59:09.356 --> 00:59:17.411
as the family grew, but the first thing you notice
is all of the tomb doors are open.

00:59:17.411 --> 00:59:31.638
Is anyone holding a torch light source, going
through this?

00:59:31.638 --> 00:59:33.721
LAURA: He's got his flaming war hammer.

00:59:33.721 --> 00:59:35.335
MARISHA: Yeah, and I'll light up my hands.

00:59:35.335 --> 00:59:37.871
TALIESIN: I think I still have a torch, actually.

00:59:37.871 --> 00:59:40.382
MATT: Have you been carrying it with you
throughout this?

00:59:40.382 --> 00:59:41.379
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:59:41.379 --> 00:59:42.226
MATT: Okay.

00:59:42.226 --> 00:59:43.112
LIAM: Dagger.

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:45.630
MATT: Okay, so you have enough light sources to
keep a general idea of what's going on, and I know

00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:50.298
a lot of you guys have darkvision, too, so you have a
pretty decent range. What's the marching order

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:53.320
here, guys? Just so I know, continuing down this
path.

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:58.749
SAM: We'll go Percy, Cassandra, Cassandra, Percy,
Percy, Percy, Percy, Cassandra.

00:59:58.749 --> 01:00:00.508
MARISHA: Boy girl, boy girl, boy girl.

01:00:00.508 --> 01:00:02.563
LAURA: I'm going to perception ahead, so I'll be
towards the front.

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.942
MATT: Towards the front?

01:00:03.942 --> 01:00:06.436
LIAM: How about Grog in second place? You big
sponge.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.320
MATT: Is Trinket staying with you or staying in
back?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.549
LAURA: He's going to stay further back.

01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:10.769
MARISHA: Put me in a happy middle.

01:00:10.769 --> 01:00:15.163
MATT: Grog's second. Keyleth is, you said, in the
middle?

01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:16.326
SAM: She's lucky Pierre.

01:00:16.326 --> 01:00:18.086
MATT: All right, the rest of you guys?

01:00:18.086 --> 01:00:21.388
LAURA: Trinket's staying close to Scanlan.

01:00:21.388 --> 01:00:23.678
MATT: Okay. Scanlan, you staying towards the
back?

01:00:23.678 --> 01:00:24.706
SAM: I guess so.

01:00:24.706 --> 01:00:26.673
MATT: All right. Percy and Vax?

01:00:26.673 --> 01:00:31.803
LIAM: I'll be behind Grog, as well.

01:00:31.803 --> 01:00:34.498
TALIESIN: So I'll be in the back with my sister.

01:00:34.498 --> 01:00:38.977
MATT: All right, and this is Cassandra.

01:00:38.977 --> 01:00:41.118
LAURA: Oh no. She's so drunk.

01:00:41.118 --> 01:00:43.768
MATT: Okay, so it's like a flying V formation you
guys are pushing in here.

01:00:43.768 --> 01:00:45.252
TALIESIN: Go home, de Rolo, you're drunk.

01:00:45.252 --> 01:00:55.925
MATT: All right, so. You progress through the
undercroft as quietly as possible. You notice as

01:00:55.925 --> 01:01:01.330
you get past the first section, you look to your
right and left and the inside of these small like

01:01:01.330 --> 01:01:08.908
cubby offshoots that contain these separate ten by
ten stone tombs. The walls have shelves burrowed

01:01:08.908 --> 01:01:17.654
into it, in which there are urns and small gems
and offerings-- things that were buried alongside

01:01:17.654 --> 01:01:21.426
the family members as part of a remembrance.

01:01:21.426 --> 01:01:23.679
LIAM and LAURA: (make snatching noises)

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:25.451
MATT: Yeah, no. Don't go Skyrim on me.

01:01:25.451 --> 01:01:27.900
TALIESIN: Yeah. Not fun.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:34.417
MATT: Once again, you see the doors are open, and
from what you can tell, the stone lids on the

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:42.280
tombs are pulled off and to the side. Across the
way, as you move towards the center of the room to

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:48.778
the second set of openings, you can see the far
wall which, the room ends in the far side, but

01:01:48.778 --> 01:01:56.658
there is about a 15, 20-foot wide and about a ten
to 15-foot tall hole burrowed into the far wall.

01:01:56.658 --> 01:02:03.036
And the closer you get, you see large piles of
dirt that fill one side of the room were put off

01:02:03.036 --> 01:02:09.143
to the side as if pieces of this dig were
discarded and there is a trail of dirt across the

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:13.979
ground that appears to have not been very well
cleaned to show that dirt was being moved in and

01:02:13.979 --> 01:02:21.195
out of this area. You also see, as you push
two-thirds into the room, broken pieces of

01:02:21.195 --> 01:02:26.422
whitestone that had been carved into what looks
like parts of walls or pillars. Support things

01:02:26.422 --> 01:02:34.220
that failed in their construction and just broke
and were tossed and discarded to the side. Make a

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.045
perception check.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.158
MARISHA: Oh!

01:02:39.158 --> 01:02:42.560
TALIESIN: Oh! Natural 20.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:43.683
SAM: Jesus.

01:02:43.683 --> 01:02:45.460
TRAVIS: What the flipping fuck, man.

01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.964
TALIESIN: I had a one today.

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:49.331
MATT: A one.

01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:50.899
TRAVIS: And four 20s.

01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:52.057
TALIESIN: I had a one.

01:02:52.057 --> 01:02:55.842
MATT: One of you Critters out there has to get
Taliesin a really, really pretty new d20 that he

01:02:55.842 --> 01:02:57.448
has to use going forward.

01:02:57.448 --> 01:03:00.417
TALIESIN: That's shapeways.com.

01:03:00.417 --> 01:03:01.662
MATT: Not that one!

01:03:01.662 --> 01:03:03.738
(laughter)

01:03:03.738 --> 01:03:06.632
MATT: All right. So what did you get?

01:03:06.632 --> 01:03:07.628
MARISHA: 29.

01:03:07.628 --> 01:03:08.528
SAM: 12.

01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:09.603
LIAM: 26.

01:03:09.603 --> 01:03:11.113
LAURA: I don't remember. It wasn't very good.

01:03:11.113 --> 01:03:11.918
MATT: Okay.

01:03:11.918 --> 01:03:12.775
TRAVIS: 13.

01:03:12.775 --> 01:03:21.046
MATT: Okay. Those of you with about 25 or above,
you glance and you find two of these slivers of

01:03:21.046 --> 01:03:31.012
this material you don't recognize and part of this
broken stone. It's like a dark green glass. About

01:03:31.012 --> 01:03:37.415
a half an inch to an inch thick in slivers. You
only find a small scattering few, and it has a

01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:48.367
grainy texture to it, and you take a look at it,
and it's transparent. You can see shapes through

01:03:48.367 --> 01:03:53.291
it, but it's opaque enough to the point where it
distorts a little bit of the visual and color

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:54.583
behind it.

01:03:54.583 --> 01:04:00.755
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check on this? Is this
similar to the broken glass that I collected

01:04:00.755 --> 01:04:01.737
before?

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.943
MATT: Which broken glass you collected before?

01:04:03.943 --> 01:04:07.987
MARISHA: I don't know. I just have broken glass
shards.

01:04:07.987 --> 01:04:10.421
TRAVIS: I feel like that was the red stones or
something from before.

01:04:10.421 --> 01:04:11.632
MARISHA: I feel like there was some sort of--

01:04:11.632 --> 01:04:13.223
TALIESIN: There was that sea of glass.

01:04:13.223 --> 01:04:15.137
MARISHA: Yeah, we were in some cavern.

01:04:15.137 --> 01:04:20.613
MATT: Oh, the sea of bone and glass? Okay. Yeah,
it is not similar to that, no. However, those who

01:04:20.613 --> 01:04:23.554
are trained in arcana, you can go ahead and make
an arcana roll.

01:04:23.554 --> 01:04:26.189
LAURA: Trained in arcana?

01:04:26.189 --> 01:04:27.404
MATT: Trained in arcana.

01:04:27.404 --> 01:04:29.319
LAURA: How do you know if you're trained in
arcana?

01:04:29.319 --> 01:04:30.474
TRAVIS: Negative two.

01:04:30.474 --> 01:04:33.190
MATT: You would have filled in, if you have a
proficiency.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:34.011
SAM: The dot?

01:04:34.011 --> 01:04:34.776
TALIESIN: The dot.

01:04:34.776 --> 01:04:35.684
LAURA: Oh.

01:04:35.684 --> 01:04:37.504
SAM: Oh. 11.

01:04:37.504 --> 01:04:43.806
MATT: You have really no idea what this glass is.

01:04:43.806 --> 01:04:45.059
LIAM: I grab it back.

01:04:45.059 --> 01:04:46.216
MATT: Okay.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:50.377
SAM: That was just me? I'm the only arcana-trained
person here?

01:04:50.377 --> 01:04:51.356
LAURA: That's it?

01:04:51.356 --> 01:04:54.951
SAM: Wow. Sorry, guys. Sorry.

01:04:54.951 --> 01:04:56.656
MARISHA: Can I try a nature check on it?

01:04:56.656 --> 01:04:58.017
MATT: Sure.

01:04:58.017 --> 01:05:02.049
MARISHA: He's like, "It's not going to tell you
shit, but sure." 15?

01:05:02.049 --> 01:05:12.964
MATT: It's glass. Most glass you understand is
designed by usually sand or other materials that

01:05:12.964 --> 01:05:17.787
at a high temperature or some sort of process is
melted and fused.

01:05:17.787 --> 01:05:22.218
MARISHA: So it's manufactured.

01:05:22.218 --> 01:05:28.811
MATT: It appears to be, or naturally occurred, and
the structure of it has this bumpy, wavy-- it's

01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:30.227
not like smooth glass.

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.495
MARISHA: Like when lightning hits sand?

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:34.526
MATT: Kind of. But you're not sure what it
actually is.

01:05:34.526 --> 01:05:36.778
LAURA: I wonder if this was holding that acid.

01:05:36.778 --> 01:05:40.660
TALIESIN: I wonder if something very, very hot...

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:43.585
MARISHA: I'm wondering if it's a symptom of
something.

01:05:43.585 --> 01:05:46.643
SAM: When they burn the whitestone with the acid
or something?

01:05:46.643 --> 01:05:50.090
LAURA: Do I see any recent tracks around here?
Does it look like people came down here?

01:05:50.090 --> 01:05:56.947
MATT: Make a survival check with advantage because
you're a crazy ranger tracker.

01:05:56.947 --> 01:06:04.158
LAURA: 13.

01:06:04.158 --> 01:06:10.468
MATT: You see tracks here and there, some fresher
than others. Yeah.

01:06:10.468 --> 01:06:12.158
LIAM: How many of us found this?

01:06:12.158 --> 01:06:15.200
MATT: Well, two of you saw it.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.415
LIAM: I've got one.

01:06:16.415 --> 01:06:17.566
MATT: Yeah, you've got one piece.

01:06:17.566 --> 01:06:18.520
LIAM: And Percy's got the other?

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:20.004
MATT: Second piece, yeah.

01:06:20.004 --> 01:06:21.419
SAM: You want to burn one?

01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:25.155
LIAM: I walk away from the group all the way to
the back, and I take it--

01:06:25.155 --> 01:06:27.548
MATT: To where you came from?

01:06:27.548 --> 01:06:33.918
LIAM: Yeah, towards where we came from. What's
behind us? Is it just tunnel back that way?

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:37.641
MATT: You mean on that path you're going?

01:06:37.641 --> 01:06:39.687
LIAM: Yeah, I push through the back of the group
to the back.

01:06:39.687 --> 01:06:40.579
MATT: Okay.

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:41.919
LIAM: What's behind us?

01:06:41.919 --> 01:06:43.988
MATT: Where you just came from is the stairs that
lead up to the castle.

01:06:43.988 --> 01:06:47.950
LIAM: I was going to throw it, but...

01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:52.372
TRAVIS: I see Vex looking around. Can I look for
tracks as well? I'm proficient in survival, and I

01:06:52.372 --> 01:06:53.645
never use it.

01:06:53.645 --> 01:06:57.109
MATT: Sure.

01:06:57.109 --> 01:07:00.408
TRAVIS: Natural 20! I swear to god.

01:07:00.408 --> 01:07:03.927
MATT: While you sit there inspecting the dirt--

01:07:03.927 --> 01:07:07.424
LAURA: It looks like there's some tracks here, but
I don't know what it's saying.

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:15.789
MATT: Grog, you immediately see a cluster of
recent footprints, probably a day old at most,

01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:28.025
that lead in towards the tunnel. Looks like the
prints are of seven individuals. Feet are fairly

01:07:28.025 --> 01:07:35.098
wide, masculine and heavy in step. One gait
appears to be smaller, thinner, and more

01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:36.389
feminine.

01:07:36.389 --> 01:07:38.673
TRAVIS: How many tombs are open around us?

01:07:38.673 --> 01:07:45.092
MATT: Eight total in this room.

01:07:45.092 --> 01:07:47.505
TRAVIS: Should we check the tombs?

01:07:47.505 --> 01:07:49.043
LAURA: They're already open and empty.

01:07:49.043 --> 01:07:50.532
SAM: They're open and empty.

01:07:50.532 --> 01:07:52.142
MATT: You all make a perception check.

01:07:52.142 --> 01:07:53.558
MARISHA: All of us?

01:07:53.558 --> 01:07:56.595
SAM: Ten.

01:07:56.595 --> 01:07:58.119
MARISHA: 28.

01:07:58.119 --> 01:07:59.418
TALIESIN: 25.

01:07:59.418 --> 01:08:00.618
LIAM: 20.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:01.903
LAURA: 11.

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:03.403
TRAVIS: 18.

01:08:03.403 --> 01:08:05.186
MATT: Okay, 20 and above that'd be just you two?

01:08:05.186 --> 01:08:06.278
LIAM: 20.

01:08:06.278 --> 01:08:12.978
MATT: Oh, yeah, three. All right, so you three,
you notice the temperature drop ever so slightly

01:08:12.978 --> 01:08:20.768
in the room and in the darkened shadow. you look
around and you see what appears to be some sort of

01:08:20.768 --> 01:08:23.061
ethereal mass drifting away.

01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:24.162
TALIESIN: Damn it!

01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:25.481
MARISHA: God damn it! Here we go again.

01:08:25.481 --> 01:08:26.597
LIAM: We've got company.

01:08:26.597 --> 01:08:29.705
MATT: There's one round that you three get to act.
The rest of you have a surprise round right now.

01:08:29.705 --> 01:08:31.996
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

01:08:31.996 --> 01:08:35.220
SAM: Bad deadly ghost mist.

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.782
MARISHA: What kind of mist?

01:08:36.782 --> 01:08:38.145
SAM: A miasma.

01:08:38.145 --> 01:08:45.773
MATT: Grog and Vex are out here checking this. You
guys are back here. Keyleth is here. Vax, you're

01:08:45.773 --> 01:08:51.622
back here. Trinket's up with you, and Scanlan
you're--

01:08:51.622 --> 01:08:52.897
SAM: I was in the back.

01:08:52.897 --> 01:09:07.187
MATT: So you're over here with these guys. You see
one drifts out from this side, another drifts out

01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:10.431
from this side, and another drifts in from this
side.

01:09:10.431 --> 01:09:13.432
MARISHA: Undead ghoulie guys?

01:09:13.432 --> 01:09:14.779
LIAM: Ghosts. Wraiths.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:16.140
MARISHA: Wraiths?

01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:23.207
MATT: There is a cold chill that runs down the
spine of Keyleth and Vax, as they've encountered

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:25.412
enemies similar to this in the past.

01:09:25.412 --> 01:09:27.774
MARISHA: It's that fucking shit that turned us.

01:09:27.774 --> 01:09:33.178
MATT: All right, let's roll some initiatives.

01:09:33.178 --> 01:09:36.656
TRAVIS: Just those three, right?

01:09:36.656 --> 01:09:37.934
MATT: Just those three.

01:09:37.934 --> 01:09:39.509
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.683
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

01:09:40.683 --> 01:09:42.022
TALIESIN: I feel like an asshole.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:42.897
MARISHA: Get out!

01:09:42.897 --> 01:09:45.430
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice. This is bullshit.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.508
MATT: Yeah, I'm banning that d20 for the rest of
the game.

01:09:47.508 --> 01:09:48.734
TALIESIN: I'm changing dice.

01:09:48.734 --> 01:09:55.176
MARISHA: It makes no sense. Yes! It's a hollow
die.

01:09:55.176 --> 01:10:00.495
TALIESIN: It's a hollow die. There's nothing to be
weighted on it. It's a wiffle die.

01:10:00.495 --> 01:10:02.308
MARISHA: And I rolled a one!

01:10:02.308 --> 01:10:06.696
MATT: So it's just you. Okay, so! Initiatives.

01:10:06.696 --> 01:10:08.785
TALIESIN: 28.

01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:11.217
MATT: (giggles) Okay.

01:10:11.217 --> 01:10:12.274
MARISHA: 14.

01:10:12.274 --> 01:10:13.309
MATT: Okay.

01:10:13.309 --> 01:10:14.125
LIAM: 15.

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.221
TALIESIN: Thank you for that.

01:10:15.221 --> 01:10:18.893
MARISHA: (laughing) I can't believe I did that.
Rolled a one on it.

01:10:18.893 --> 01:10:23.727
MATT: All right. Percy, you're up first. You
glance around, and you can see the two entities

01:10:23.727 --> 01:10:29.490
going (hiss) towards you, towards Keyleth, and you
glance over your shoulder and see one drifting out

01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:31.133
of the distance towards Vax.

01:10:31.133 --> 01:10:37.133
TALIESIN: I yell, "Look out!" And I take several
steps toward Vax.

01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:42.126
MATT: To there?

01:10:42.126 --> 01:10:45.638
TALIESIN: Actually, on the other side of the
pillar so I can actually see the one that's

01:10:45.638 --> 01:10:46.938
getting towards him.

01:10:46.938 --> 01:10:47.956
MATT: There?

01:10:47.956 --> 01:10:48.622
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:10:48.622 --> 01:10:51.423
MATT: You won't be able to see this one, just
those. This one actually will block your view to

01:10:51.423 --> 01:10:57.295
that one. These are about ten feet tall. These are
the little sections here, so right now, you would

01:10:57.295 --> 01:11:04.723
be able to see these two here and barely see this
one. It would have three-quarters cover. Which you

01:11:04.723 --> 01:11:05.848
ignore, with Sharpshooter.

01:11:05.848 --> 01:11:10.326
TALIESIN: I know. I want to back up into that
corner, though, just to get away from them.

01:11:10.326 --> 01:11:11.380
MATT: Over here?

01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.289
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:11:12.289 --> 01:11:14.712
MATT: Okay, so you can see one of them right now.

01:11:14.712 --> 01:11:23.292
TALIESIN: I'll take-- fuck. Yep, screw it. I'll
take shots with the Pepperbox.

01:11:23.292 --> 01:11:24.567
MATT: Okay.

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:25.846
TALIESIN: I'll take my first shot.

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:27.022
MATT: Go for it.

01:11:27.022 --> 01:11:32.017
TALIESIN: That can't be right. Just checking. 20.
Natural 20.

01:11:32.017 --> 01:11:32.926
MATT: Okay.

01:11:32.926 --> 01:11:33.838
LAURA: With a different dice?

01:11:33.838 --> 01:11:36.178
TALIESIN: With a different die. Of course, with a
different die.

01:11:36.178 --> 01:11:37.488
MARISHA: Shut the fuck up!

01:11:37.488 --> 01:11:39.050
TRAVIS: Who are you?

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:44.480
TALIESIN: I'm the devil. I am the devil, and I
have come to do the devil's work.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:47.995
MATT: So all of you who are going to conventions
to meet Taliesin in the future, make sure you get

01:11:47.995 --> 01:11:51.082
a nice long hold of his hand so you can roll
better, too.

01:11:51.082 --> 01:11:52.232
TRAVIS: Yeah, would you touch my dice?

01:11:52.232 --> 01:11:55.798
TALIESIN: I will lick your die, because that is
how I bless them.

01:11:55.798 --> 01:12:01.077
MATT: All right, so that's your first attack.
Second attack?

01:12:01.077 --> 01:12:02.316
TALIESIN: First attack.

01:12:02.316 --> 01:12:03.698
MATT: Both at the same guy?

01:12:03.698 --> 01:12:07.882
TALIESIN: Yeah, all against the same guy.

01:12:07.882 --> 01:12:09.190
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:14.774
TALIESIN: First attack is 22 points of damage.

01:12:14.774 --> 01:12:16.710
MATT: Okay, is this with the element, or not?

01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:17.788
TALIESIN: No, no element.

01:12:17.788 --> 01:12:20.557
MATT: Okay. You fire. Just passes through it with
no effect.

01:12:20.557 --> 01:12:24.396
MARISHA: Yeah, fucking misty dudes.

01:12:24.396 --> 01:12:25.624
TRAVIS: What?

01:12:25.624 --> 01:12:28.788
MARISHA: Damn misty dudes. I'm mocking them.

01:12:28.788 --> 01:12:30.199
TALIESIN: I spin.

01:12:30.199 --> 01:12:31.154
MATT: Okay.

01:12:31.154 --> 01:12:34.320
TALIESIN: Shoot with fire.

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.866
MATT: Okay.

01:12:36.866 --> 01:12:38.598
TALIESIN: What the fuck?!

01:12:38.598 --> 01:12:41.109
MARISHA: Get out!

01:12:41.109 --> 01:12:42.834
MATT: Take a picture. Take a picture right now.

01:12:42.834 --> 01:12:43.938
TALIESIN: Taking a picture.

01:12:43.938 --> 01:12:45.084
MARISHA: Get out! You're the anti-Wheaton.

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:46.265
SAM: He's had, like, eight tonight.

01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:47.208
MARISHA: How many is that?

01:12:47.208 --> 01:12:48.579
TALIESIN: I don't know!

01:12:48.579 --> 01:12:53.093
MARISHA: CritRoleStats, how many is that? Tell us!
I know you've been counting.

01:12:53.093 --> 01:12:54.911
LAURA: Ridiculous.

01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:57.686
SAM: Go to Vegas!

01:12:57.686 --> 01:12:59.087
TALIESIN: I'll put it on Instagram later.

01:12:59.087 --> 01:13:00.518
MARISHA: Go to Vegas!

01:13:00.518 --> 01:13:01.518
LAURA: Yeah.

01:13:01.518 --> 01:13:03.297
TALIESIN: I go to Vegas. I don't gamble!

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:04.397
LAURA: We need to go.

01:13:04.397 --> 01:13:07.127
MATT: You need to go find the D&amp;amp;D casino.

01:13:07.127 --> 01:13:09.682
SAM: D&amp;amp;D casino?

01:13:09.682 --> 01:13:11.995
MATT: D&amp;amp;D casino. Make it happen, guys. I know one
of you can.

01:13:11.995 --> 01:13:13.077
TALIESIN: All right.

01:13:13.077 --> 01:13:15.143
MATT: So which one is this?

01:13:15.143 --> 01:13:17.894
TALIESIN: This is fire elemental.

01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:18.790
MATT: Okay.

01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:27.721
TALIESIN: That's 14 points of damage, plus three
damage of fire.

01:13:27.721 --> 01:13:29.259
MATT: That's including crit damage?

01:13:29.259 --> 01:13:32.032
TALIESIN: Including the crit damage. I rolled
really poorly on my damage.

01:13:32.032 --> 01:13:36.997
MATT: Okay, so this one, the bullet does (impact
noise) hit its form with a burst of flame, the

01:13:36.997 --> 01:13:42.455
bullet converted to magical due to the nature of
the chamber. You can see its form (raspy cry). It

01:13:42.455 --> 01:13:45.727
disperses for a second and then re-forms,
continuing its movement.

01:13:45.727 --> 01:13:47.486
TALIESIN: We need magic! I'm taking my last
shot.

01:13:47.486 --> 01:13:48.511
MATT: Okay.

01:13:48.511 --> 01:13:52.131
MARISHA: That was seven, by the way. Seven 20s
this game.

01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:53.635
MATT: That's stupid.

01:13:53.635 --> 01:13:57.078
TALIESIN: Okay, see? That's better. 15.

01:13:57.078 --> 01:13:58.892
MATT: 15 does hit.

01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:08.686
TALIESIN: All right. They're easy to hit, at
least. That's such a shitty roll. 12 points of ice

01:14:08.686 --> 01:14:09.690
damage.

01:14:09.690 --> 01:14:16.731
MATT: Okay. The ice shot (gunshot) tears through
it, doing additional damage. You see part of its

01:14:16.731 --> 01:14:20.102
form crystallize from the little bit of ectoplasm
that's floating in the air, but it's not enough to

01:14:20.102 --> 01:14:28.142
actually disperse its form. It continues pushing
forward. You would have to reload to use those

01:14:28.142 --> 01:14:29.112
again.

01:14:29.112 --> 01:14:30.345
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm out.

01:14:30.345 --> 01:14:36.856
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. It's now their
go. This one drifts forward to Keyleth. This one

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:38.890
drifts forward to Grog.

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:41.199
MARISHA: That's with our surprise round? You said
we have a surprise round.

01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:44.977
MATT: No, you guys were aware. Everyone else is
surprised.

01:14:44.977 --> 01:14:49.899
MARISHA: Oh, we're the only three that aren't
surprised. Oh, that sucks.

01:14:49.899 --> 01:14:54.710
MATT: So. Unless you do anything against
surprise?

01:14:54.710 --> 01:14:56.205
TRAVIS: Not unless I'm raging.

01:14:56.205 --> 01:15:06.471
MATT: That's true. All right. Keyleth, I need you
to make a constitution saving throw. Sorry, no, a

01:15:06.471 --> 01:15:07.848
charisma saving throw.

01:15:07.848 --> 01:15:13.941
MARISHA: A charisma saving throw? That's not
great. And no saving throw bonuses, okay, so

01:15:13.941 --> 01:15:15.381
that's ten?

01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:17.672
LIAM: (quietly) Oh, she's gone.

01:15:17.719 --> 01:15:19.880
MARISHA: We've been here before.

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.419
MATT: Did you roll already?

01:15:21.419 --> 01:15:22.620
MARISHA: I did.

01:15:22.620 --> 01:15:23.741
MATT: What did you get?

01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:24.747
MARISHA: Ten.

01:15:24.747 --> 01:15:35.326
MATT: Ten. Okay. The ghost reaches out and
embraces Keyleth. It disappears into her form and

01:15:35.362 --> 01:15:38.827
she shivers for a second, and it is no longer
visible.

01:15:38.827 --> 01:15:40.887
LAURA: Oh, he's taken over her body?

01:15:40.887 --> 01:15:45.252
MATT: Keyleth's eyes all of a sudden flare up with
a ghostly blue glow, and she turns around, looking

01:15:45.252 --> 01:15:53.941
at the group with a hunger you haven't seen in her
eyes. For those who see it, as well-- I should

01:15:53.941 --> 01:15:57.734
have made this happen before-- I need you guys to
immediately after seeing these ghosts make a

01:15:57.734 --> 01:15:58.999
wisdom saving throw.

01:15:58.999 --> 01:15:59.934
TALIESIN: What for?

01:15:59.934 --> 01:16:00.777
SAM: Everyone?

01:16:00.777 --> 01:16:01.870
MATT: No, just the ones that see it.

01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:04.595
LAURA: We're all immune to fear because of the
feast.

01:16:04.595 --> 01:16:06.861
MATT: That's right, so never mind. That doesn't
matter.

01:16:06.861 --> 01:16:08.507
SAM: (laughs) Yeah!

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:13.967
MATT: Good reminding. So I was right, then. I
didn't forget anything! All right,

01:16:13.967 --> 01:16:15.674
charisma saving throw?

01:16:15.674 --> 01:16:17.805
LIAM: Charisma saving throw?

01:16:17.805 --> 01:16:18.798
MATT: Correct.

01:16:18.798 --> 01:16:19.746
LIAM: Okay.

01:16:19.746 --> 01:16:20.988
MARISHA: This isn't a charm thing?

01:16:20.988 --> 01:16:22.670
MATT: And Grog, charisma saving throw.

01:16:22.670 --> 01:16:23.640
LAURA: Is this charm?

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:28.382
MATT: Nope. This is not a charm.

01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:32.318
LIAM: Okay, so a 12 for me. Am I caught, as well?

01:16:32.318 --> 01:16:33.319
SAM: 12?

01:16:33.319 --> 01:16:34.228
MATT: 12?

01:16:34.228 --> 01:16:35.067
LIAM: Yeah.

01:16:35.067 --> 01:16:35.964
MATT: Okay.

01:16:35.964 --> 01:16:39.213
TALIESIN: God damn it.

01:16:39.213 --> 01:16:41.026
SAM: That was your last Luck, too.

01:16:41.026 --> 01:16:42.795
LIAM: No, that's two, isn't it?

01:16:42.795 --> 01:16:44.115
MARISHA: You did two.

01:16:44.115 --> 01:16:45.905
LAURA: We're going to die!

01:16:45.905 --> 01:16:47.906
TRAVIS: Grog is batting for the other team.

01:16:47.906 --> 01:16:49.378
MATT: What did you roll?

01:16:49.378 --> 01:16:50.460
TRAVIS: Four.

01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:54.272
LAURA: (muffled) We don't even have a cleric with
us!

01:16:54.272 --> 01:16:57.049
SAM: Wait, this is against charisma?

01:16:57.049 --> 01:16:58.347
LAURA and MARISHA: Yeah.

01:16:58.347 --> 01:16:59.449
SAM: Jesus.

01:16:59.449 --> 01:17:06.422
MATT: And with that, three of your teammates turn
around, their eyes intensely glowing with some

01:17:06.422 --> 01:17:09.385
sort of a weird ghostly glow.

01:17:09.385 --> 01:17:13.124
MARISHA: Three v three, man. Battle royale. Let's
do this.

01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:14.426
TALIESIN: Oh god.

01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:16.508
SAM: Wait, we have to fight them?

01:17:16.508 --> 01:17:18.870
MARISHA: He's going to call it at eight. He's
going to call it.

01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:20.614
MATT: Everyone else roll initiative.

01:17:20.614 --> 01:17:23.537
SAM: We have to fight them. How is that going to
happen?

01:17:23.579 --> 01:17:25.531
TALIESIN: This is going to go so poorly.

01:17:25.531 --> 01:17:27.726
TRAVIS: Not us. Not the possessed ones, right?

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:31.080
MATT: No, you guys are already on the initiative.
Oh, no. Grog, you still do.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.454
TRAVIS: I still roll initiative?

01:17:32.454 --> 01:17:33.654
MATT: Yeah, for yourself.

01:17:33.654 --> 01:17:35.121
LAURA: What?

01:17:35.121 --> 01:17:37.305
TRAVIS: I'm possessed, though.

01:17:37.305 --> 01:17:45.155
TALIESIN: Roll your initiative.

01:17:45.155 --> 01:17:46.521
LIAM: What just happened?

01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:49.479
LAURA: You have to roll initiative to see when you
attack all of us.

01:17:49.479 --> 01:17:50.528
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:50.528 --> 01:17:52.263
TRAVIS: Well, then it's good it was a one.

01:17:52.263 --> 01:17:54.226
MATT: (laughs) Okay.

01:17:54.226 --> 01:17:56.566
MARISHA: Do we roll initiative, too? We're
re-rolling initiative, the three of us?

01:17:56.566 --> 01:18:00.358
MATT: Everyone who hasn't rolled yet rolls now.

01:18:00.358 --> 01:18:01.449
MARISHA: Oh.

01:18:01.449 --> 01:18:02.540
SAM: 15.

01:18:02.540 --> 01:18:03.706
MATT: 15. Okay.

01:18:03.706 --> 01:18:05.069
TRAVIS: Unless I have to roll with advantage.

01:18:05.069 --> 01:18:07.535
SAM: Do you have to roll with advantage?

01:18:07.535 --> 01:18:10.724
MATT: Technically, you would, yeah.

01:18:10.724 --> 01:18:12.028
TRAVIS: Two.

01:18:12.028 --> 01:18:14.454
MATT: All right, and what did you get?

01:18:14.454 --> 01:18:15.291
LAURA: 13.

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:19.675
MATT: 13. All right. Percy, you're up first.

01:18:19.675 --> 01:18:24.195
MARISHA: Help us!

01:18:24.195 --> 01:18:26.251
TALIESIN: I don't know what to do.

01:18:26.251 --> 01:18:28.029
LAURA: We don't have a cleric!

01:18:28.029 --> 01:18:30.936
SAM: You have-- ugh.

01:18:30.936 --> 01:18:32.481
MARISHA: I think you guys--

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:35.254
SAM: No, it's up to us to figure out, right?

01:18:35.254 --> 01:18:37.450
LAURA: He cast Turn Undead. We don't have that.

01:18:37.450 --> 01:18:38.917
MARISHA: Was that when Kashaw was here?

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:39.733
LAURA: Yeah.

01:18:39.733 --> 01:18:41.852
MARISHA: That was Kashaw. Yeah, he cast Turn
Undead.

01:18:41.852 --> 01:18:43.725
TRAVIS: Awesome. He's not here right now. What are
you going to do?

01:18:43.725 --> 01:18:44.952
TALIESIN: Okay! What are we going to do?

01:18:44.952 --> 01:18:46.508
MATT: What are you going to do?

01:18:46.508 --> 01:18:53.298
TALIESIN: (sighs) All right, who's the most
dangerous?

01:18:53.298 --> 01:18:54.970
TRAVIS: Does Cassandra have any--

01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:59.665
TALIESIN: That's my first action. I'm going to use
my bonus action to turn to my sister and go, what

01:18:59.665 --> 01:19:01.740
the hell do we do?

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:08.049
MATT: She looks at you, a little bit frustrated.

01:19:08.049 --> 01:19:14.886
MARISHA: Please tell me she trained in cleric.
Please tell me she multiclassed.

01:19:14.886 --> 01:19:28.657
MATT: She looks about, annoyed, and goes, "I'm
sorry. I'm not a holy woman. I have no symbols. I

01:19:28.657 --> 01:19:31.461
"have no power. I have nothing. Let's see what we
can do."

01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:35.095
TALIESIN: All right. I'm--

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:38.572
MARISHA: You guys have that holy water, right?

01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:43.885
TALIESIN: I'm backing up. I'm going to do my best
to back up into the tomb right here.

01:19:43.885 --> 01:19:45.310
MATT: Right there?

01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:51.220
TALIESIN: Keep going to my right until the
drop-off behind me, and I'm going to back up into

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.301
the tomb.

01:19:52.301 --> 01:19:54.104
MATT: Okay. Into there?

01:19:54.104 --> 01:19:57.152
TALIESIN: No, up. Towards you; the other side.

01:19:57.152 --> 01:19:58.148
MATT: There we go.

01:19:58.148 --> 01:19:59.868
TALIESIN: There we go. I'm putting my back against
the wall.

01:19:59.868 --> 01:20:01.505
MATT: Okay, so you're up against the stone?

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:02.546
TALIESIN: I mean that column.

01:20:02.546 --> 01:20:04.705
MARISHA: Take the damn laser pointer.

01:20:04.705 --> 01:20:06.145
TALIESIN: Yeah, there.

01:20:06.145 --> 01:20:07.182
MATT: There you go.

01:20:07.182 --> 01:20:08.197
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:20:08.197 --> 01:20:09.411
MATT: All right.

01:20:09.411 --> 01:20:15.300
TALIESIN: I'm unloading two shots. I'm reloading
and unloading two magical shots at Vax.

01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.827
MATT: Okay.

01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:31.573
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn some fucking points.
What am I going to do?

01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:35.200
SAM: We're fucked!

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.052
TRAVIS: Do your worst.

01:20:37.052 --> 01:20:44.555
TALIESIN: First shot-- fuck it, I'm using the old
die. I've already rolled two 20s on that one.

01:20:44.555 --> 01:20:51.843
First shot, I'm shooting to get Vax to drop his
knives.

01:20:51.843 --> 01:20:53.309
MATT: Okay.

01:20:53.309 --> 01:20:55.225
TALIESIN: Burning a grit point to drop his knife.

01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:56.430
MARISHA: Good idea!

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.861
MATT: He has two, so you only knock--

01:20:57.861 --> 01:21:01.732
TALIESIN: One of them out of his hand. The one
that doesn't auto-return.

01:21:01.732 --> 01:21:03.669
LIAM: They all do.

01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:04.697
TALIESIN: They all do?

01:21:04.697 --> 01:21:05.538
LIAM: Yeah.

01:21:05.538 --> 01:21:08.225
MATT: That crazy belt, man.

01:21:08.225 --> 01:21:15.247
TALIESIN: Shooting him in the face. Fuck it. And
my gun jams. You did that!

01:21:15.247 --> 01:21:16.810
MARISHA: I touched it. I'm sorry!

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:22.678
MATT: (laughs) You turn around and holding your
gun out at Vax, even with this ghostly form, it's

01:21:22.678 --> 01:21:27.307
so hard to do so, and you close your eyes for a
second and you pull the trigger, and in a weird

01:21:27.307 --> 01:21:34.546
way you're both immediately distraught and at the
same time relieved that the gun jammed.

01:21:34.546 --> 01:21:35.605
(mechanical noise)

01:21:35.605 --> 01:21:36.948
TALIESIN: (frustrated noise)

01:21:36.948 --> 01:21:38.088
MATT: So that's your turn.

01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:38.987
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:21:38.987 --> 01:21:53.085
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up first. The ghost
drives you to turn up to him as he's trying to fix

01:21:53.085 --> 01:22:00.037
the gun. Daggers out. Go ahead and make your two
attacks against him. No sneak attack damage.

01:22:00.037 --> 01:22:06.160
LIAM: The first was a 13. The second was a 22.

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:07.700
MATT: Pretty sure the 22 hits.

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:08.607
TALIESIN: 22 hits.

01:22:08.607 --> 01:22:11.081
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage against
Percy.

01:22:11.081 --> 01:22:13.955
LIAM: Eight.

01:22:13.955 --> 01:22:19.923
MATT: All right, so you take eight points of
piercing damage. You feel the blade (pained cry)

01:22:19.923 --> 01:22:23.518
pierce into the side. It doesn't get too far in,
but you haven't been on the receiving end of his

01:22:23.518 --> 01:22:28.713
daggers before, and it's not fun seeing what they
do to others. All right, at the end of your turn,

01:22:28.713 --> 01:22:36.440
I want you to make a religion check.

01:22:36.487 --> 01:22:38.584
SAM: Check?

01:22:38.584 --> 01:22:39.936
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

01:22:39.936 --> 01:22:41.148
MARISHA: Come on.

01:22:41.148 --> 01:22:43.181
TALIESIN: Magic fingers.

01:22:43.181 --> 01:22:44.410
LAURA: Magic glove.

01:22:44.410 --> 01:22:46.063
MARISHA: Do you want Taliesin to lick it?

01:22:46.063 --> 01:22:48.317
LIAM: 18.

01:22:48.317 --> 01:22:56.254
MATT: 18? That gentle glow left behind, that
slight sliver of Pike's essence that went into

01:22:56.254 --> 01:23:04.812
your symbol of Sarenrae, flares for a second. It
flares again, and for a moment, in your head, in

01:23:04.812 --> 01:23:08.257
which darkness has taken your vision, you feel
your body moving on its own, but you have no

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:15.873
control. You hear Pike's voice whisper in your ear
from a distance. It says, "Vax? It's okay." At

01:23:15.873 --> 01:23:21.277
which point, suddenly you feel the coldness sucked
out from you. The symbol flares for a second, and

01:23:21.277 --> 01:23:23.519
the ghost is thrust out of your form.

01:23:23.519 --> 01:23:24.775
MARISHA: (excited shout)

01:23:24.775 --> 01:23:26.274
TALIESIN: Yeah!

01:23:26.274 --> 01:23:34.046
MATT: That is your turn, however. All right.
Scanlan, you're up.

01:23:34.046 --> 01:23:52.045
SAM: I read my Scroll of Spirit Guardians. I call
them forth to protect us in this moment.

01:23:52.045 --> 01:23:54.555
TALIESIN: Treguna mekoides--

01:23:54.595 --> 01:23:55.857
SAM: Hakuna matata.

01:23:55.857 --> 01:23:57.697
TALIESIN: Trecorum satis dee.

01:23:57.697 --> 01:23:59.853
SAM: I don't know how this works.

01:23:59.853 --> 01:24:01.832
(laughter)

01:24:01.832 --> 01:24:03.341
MATT: That's okay.

01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:10.887
SAM: (silly voice) They attack bad things around
me, and they don't like bad things, so I thought

01:24:10.887 --> 01:24:12.336
maybe that would be good.

01:24:12.336 --> 01:24:14.463
(laughter)

01:24:14.463 --> 01:24:25.029
SAM: Spirit Guardians. The thing I bought from
Gilmore. Right? Didn't I buy the Scroll of Spirit

01:24:25.029 --> 01:24:26.369
Guardians?

01:24:26.369 --> 01:24:27.972
LAURA: Yeah, you did.

01:24:27.972 --> 01:24:32.614
SAM: They attack anything evil within 15 feet of
me.

01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:34.468
MATT: Indeed.

01:24:34.468 --> 01:24:39.277
SAM: Necrotic damage.

01:24:39.277 --> 01:24:45.453
MATT: There we go: Spirit Guardians. So you call
forth spirits to protect you for the duration, for

01:24:45.453 --> 01:24:50.956
up to ten minutes. Your alignment is...?

01:24:50.956 --> 01:24:52.163
SAM: Good?

01:24:52.163 --> 01:24:53.122
MATT: Good, yeah.

01:24:53.122 --> 01:25:02.212
SAM: Good-ish. Sort of devious good.

01:25:02.212 --> 01:25:09.145
MATT: Okay, so here's what you do. You actually
use this to create these guardians-- this spell

01:25:09.145 --> 01:25:13.289
hasn't been used, either. To a distance of 15
feet. You have to choose things within 15 feet of

01:25:13.289 --> 01:25:14.829
you, so you have these two right here.

01:25:14.829 --> 01:25:17.193
SAM: They're both within 15 feet of me, aren't
they?

01:25:17.193 --> 01:25:22.579
MATT: So, these guys. Their speed is halved.

01:25:22.579 --> 01:25:30.047
SAM: When they take their turn, they get 3d8
damage.

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:31.704
MATT: Yeah.

01:25:31.704 --> 01:25:37.580
SAM: It's a very confusing spell.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:43.612
MATT: Yeah, when they move within 15 feet of you,
their speed is halved, and at the start or when

01:25:43.612 --> 01:25:46.445
they enter the area, they make a wisdom saving
throw or take radiant damage.

01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:47.846
SAM: Is that now or when they move?

01:25:47.846 --> 01:25:49.573
MATT: That will be at the end of their turn.

01:25:49.573 --> 01:25:51.691
TALIESIN: Yay, radiant damage. That's awesome.

01:25:51.691 --> 01:25:52.879
SAM: I know.

01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:54.957
TALIESIN: You made a good call.

01:25:54.957 --> 01:25:55.987
TRAVIS: Nice, dude.

01:25:55.987 --> 01:26:01.750
MATT: All right. Does that end your turn?

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.388
SAM: Do I get a bonus action?

01:26:03.388 --> 01:26:05.467
MATT: You get a bonus action, yes.

01:26:05.467 --> 01:26:14.100
SAM: Okay. Who's not undead right now? You? I've
already inspired you once. Sure, I'll inspire you

01:26:14.100 --> 01:26:23.226
again. I've got nothing. This time, I'll just go,
(harmonica noises).

01:26:23.226 --> 01:26:25.691
LAURA: I feel really inspired.

01:26:25.691 --> 01:26:30.891
MATT: Take the lamest d10 you've ever accepted,
because harmonica's not your favorite instrument.

01:26:30.891 --> 01:26:41.218
All righty. Great. That brings us to Keyleth's
turn.

01:26:41.218 --> 01:26:48.358
TALIESIN: (squeaking noise)

01:26:48.358 --> 01:26:51.859
MARISHA: Did you just squeak?

01:26:51.859 --> 01:26:55.940
TALIESIN: Maybe. You don't know. Shut up!

01:26:55.940 --> 01:27:02.487
MATT: So it turns towards Scanlan, having cast
that, and you make a staff attack against him.

01:27:02.487 --> 01:27:04.383
MARISHA: (grunts)

01:27:04.383 --> 01:27:16.559
SAM: I do a little doo-wop. (vocalizes) And that's
my Cutting Words to try to distract her from her

01:27:16.559 --> 01:27:17.418
attack.

01:27:17.418 --> 01:27:18.938
MATT: Okay. Go for it.

01:27:18.938 --> 01:27:20.015
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

01:27:20.015 --> 01:27:21.061
SAM: Do I roll now?

01:27:21.061 --> 01:27:23.486
MATT: Yeah, you roll a d10 and subtract that from
her attack.

01:27:23.486 --> 01:27:24.553
MARISHA: I rolled a 19.

01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:26.582
SAM: Two.

01:27:26.582 --> 01:27:28.024
MATT: So it's a 17.

01:27:28.024 --> 01:27:29.157
MARISHA: What's your AC?

01:27:29.157 --> 01:27:31.020
SAM: I have a 17 armor class.

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:32.560
MATT: Roll damage.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:36.691
SAM: Oh, wait! No, that's a ten. That's right.

01:27:36.691 --> 01:27:42.675
MARISHA: It's not a lot of damage, I promise. Oh,
see? Even better. Four damage.

01:27:42.675 --> 01:27:45.158
SAM: Oh. I shouldn't have even wasted it.

01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:46.138
TALIESIN: It's "ow."

01:27:46.138 --> 01:27:48.218
LAURA: It's just your little staff?

01:27:48.218 --> 01:27:50.309
SAM: You're adorable.

01:27:50.309 --> 01:27:51.785
MARISHA: I'm still doing my granny routine.

01:27:51.785 --> 01:28:02.289
MATT: Okay, now it has to make a wisdom saving
throw, which it succeeds. It still takes half as

01:28:02.289 --> 01:28:04.756
much damage, so roll 3d8.

01:28:04.756 --> 01:28:05.809
SAM: Who, me?

01:28:05.809 --> 01:28:06.681
MATT: Yes.

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:15.041
SAM: Oh. Yes. Of course I will. I will do that
right now with these d8s that I have. 12.

01:28:15.041 --> 01:28:28.227
MATT: Okay. All righty. So this burst of radiant
energy burns around her. You take 12 points of

01:28:28.227 --> 01:28:29.245
radiant damage.

01:28:29.245 --> 01:28:33.106
MARISHA: 12 points?

01:28:33.106 --> 01:28:37.337
MATT: Yep. Vex, you're up.

01:28:37.337 --> 01:28:39.731
LAURA: All right.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.782
MATT: You see Grog turn to you with this wicked
grin on his face, eyes glowing a pale whitish-blue

01:28:43.782 --> 01:28:46.005
as he brings the hammer up in the air.

01:28:46.005 --> 01:28:51.484
LAURA: Oh god! Am I close by him?

01:28:51.484 --> 01:28:53.878
MATT: You are. You're right next to him.

01:28:53.878 --> 01:28:55.248
LAURA: I'm right next to him?

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:56.440
MATT: You're right there.

01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:03.507
LAURA: Oh no! I back away from him. He's going to
get an attack on me.

01:29:03.507 --> 01:29:04.551
MATT: Yep.

01:29:04.551 --> 01:29:06.613
LAURA: But I really needed to put some distance
there.

01:29:06.613 --> 01:29:08.311
MATT: Make an attack of opportunity.

01:29:08.311 --> 01:29:10.659
LAURA: Wait! Okay, that's good.

01:29:10.659 --> 01:29:13.271
TRAVIS: 13.

01:29:13.271 --> 01:29:14.654
LAURA: You don't hit me!

01:29:14.654 --> 01:29:19.711
MATT: Whiff. (impact noise) The hammer hits the
side of the stonework, cracking it a little.

01:29:19.711 --> 01:29:20.985
TALIESIN: Oh, that's my mausoleum.

01:29:20.985 --> 01:29:23.174
MATT: What are you doing, Vex?

01:29:23.174 --> 01:29:30.621
LAURA: I'm going to have Trinket-- is he lined up
with anybody?

01:29:30.621 --> 01:29:34.523
MATT: Just Keyleth right now.

01:29:34.523 --> 01:29:37.706
LAURA: He can't cannonball through to Grog and
Keyleth?

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.105
MATT: He can, but he'll hit Scanlan, as well.

01:29:40.105 --> 01:29:42.205
LAURA: Can you dodge, Scanlan?

01:29:42.205 --> 01:29:47.092
SAM: We'll see. Let's do this. I always loved that
bear.

01:29:47.092 --> 01:29:50.219
LAURA: Right! You deserve it. He's doing it.

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:58.407
MATT: We'll say Trinket backs up a little bit to
get enough room on it. Keyleth, swing an attack.

01:29:58.407 --> 01:30:01.083
MARISHA: Oh, to Trinket?

01:30:01.083 --> 01:30:04.148
MATT: Yeah. Trinket has to get enough distance to
actually build up momentum.

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:05.845
MARISHA: Oh, I think that hits. 20 total?

01:30:05.845 --> 01:30:08.804
MATT: 20 total is exactly the AC. Roll damage for
Trinket.

01:30:08.804 --> 01:30:11.321
MARISHA: It's okay. It's not a lot. Nine?

01:30:11.321 --> 01:30:13.628
MATT: Trinket takes nine points of bludgeoning
damage from the staff.

01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:14.669
LAURA: Halved?

01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:22.287
MATT: Right, yeah, because it's bludgeoning, so
five points. Trinket then rolls forward, (thudding

01:30:22.332 --> 01:30:27.928
noises). Roll attacks on Grog, Scanlan, and
Keyleth.

01:30:27.928 --> 01:30:30.639
MARISHA: Trinket bowling.

01:30:30.639 --> 01:30:40.984
LAURA: Eight plus 16 is 24.

01:30:40.984 --> 01:30:45.656
MATT: For who? Keyleth, Scanlan, and Grog.

01:30:45.656 --> 01:30:47.646
LAURA: Okay, so Keyleth is 24.

01:30:47.646 --> 01:30:48.718
MARISHA: Hits.

01:30:48.718 --> 01:30:50.724
LAURA: Scanlan is 18.

01:30:50.724 --> 01:30:51.528
SAM: Hits.

01:30:51.528 --> 01:30:52.945
LAURA: And Grog is 18.

01:30:52.945 --> 01:30:54.084
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:30:54.084 --> 01:30:55.585
LAURA: No, Grog is 20.

01:30:55.585 --> 01:30:56.704
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:30:56.704 --> 01:31:02.086
MATT: All three hit? All right, so no attacks of
opportunity against Trinket. Roll damage, and

01:31:02.086 --> 01:31:03.479
everyone takes that damage.

01:31:03.479 --> 01:31:06.982
LAURA: I don't know what to roll for cannonball
damage because I've never actually gotten to hit.

01:31:06.982 --> 01:31:09.235
MATT: Oh, I know. I have this. It's 2d6 plus
four.

01:31:09.235 --> 01:31:13.088
LAURA: Okay. For each person?

01:31:13.088 --> 01:31:13.978
MATT: Yep.

01:31:13.978 --> 01:31:18.517
LAURA: Oh, okay, so ten for Keyleth.

01:31:18.517 --> 01:31:20.417
MATT: Ten points of bludgeoning damage.

01:31:20.417 --> 01:31:24.906
LAURA: Seven plus four is 11 for Scanlan.

01:31:24.906 --> 01:31:25.890
SAM: Okay.

01:31:25.890 --> 01:31:29.772
LAURA: Oh, less for Grog. Eight.

01:31:29.772 --> 01:31:31.242
MATT: Eight points of damage for Grog.

01:31:31.242 --> 01:31:36.739
LAURA: And while he's doing-- I don't get to shoot
an arrow. Yes, I do! I get to shoot an arrow.

01:31:36.739 --> 01:31:37.611
MATT: Bonus.

01:31:37.611 --> 01:31:41.322
LAURA: I'm going to shoot an arrow as Trinket is
hitting Grog.

01:31:41.322 --> 01:31:42.254
MATT: Okay.

01:31:42.254 --> 01:31:50.546
LAURA: Oh god. 14 doesn't hit him.

01:31:50.546 --> 01:31:56.490
MATT: Nope. It hits the shoulder and gleans off
and carves a little wound across his chest, but not

01:31:56.490 --> 01:32:01.488
enough to do any damage. That ends your turn.
Grog.

01:32:01.535 --> 01:32:04.750
LAURA: And now Trinket is close to me, then. Did
he go through them and get back to me?

01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:07.526
MATT: Trinket, due to the line, slams into Grog at
the end of it, so he is now between the three

01:32:07.526 --> 01:32:08.461
others.

01:32:08.461 --> 01:32:09.594
LAURA: Shit.

01:32:09.594 --> 01:32:20.051
MATT: Grog. As a ghost, you just got shot and
slammed by a bear. I want you to roll one d20.

01:32:20.051 --> 01:32:22.438
MARISHA: Oh, he's going to see if he raged.

01:32:22.438 --> 01:32:25.705
TRAVIS: 15.

01:32:25.705 --> 01:32:30.830
MATT: 15. Your attention goes to Vex, as opposed
to Trinket. You move out of the way.

01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:33.399
SAM: And he takes 3d8.

01:32:33.399 --> 01:32:35.455
MATT: That's true.

01:32:35.455 --> 01:32:41.332
SAM: Eight plus nine is 17.

01:32:41.332 --> 01:32:49.375
MATT: Well, the creature has to make a wisdom
save. Fails, so yeah, takes 3d8. Yep.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.945
SAM: 17.

01:32:50.945 --> 01:32:52.164
MATT: 17.

01:32:52.164 --> 01:32:53.199
TRAVIS: 17 to hit?

01:32:53.199 --> 01:32:54.982
SAM: No, I just hit you with 17 points of damage.

01:32:54.982 --> 01:32:55.917
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:32:55.917 --> 01:33:04.306
MATT: All right. You're feeling the ghostly form--
you take the damage as soon as the form inside;

01:33:04.306 --> 01:33:11.164
you're feeling this dissipation. All right, so you
make your two attacks against Vex.

01:33:11.164 --> 01:33:12.177
LAURA: Shit.

01:33:12.177 --> 01:33:15.505
TRAVIS: Oh, that's not awesome. That's 17.

01:33:15.505 --> 01:33:16.716
LAURA: Doesn't hit.

01:33:16.716 --> 01:33:19.571
TRAVIS: That does. 24.

01:33:19.571 --> 01:33:25.075
MATT: Yeah. Go ahead and roll damage. The first
hammer swing you're ready for. Swing backward. It

01:33:25.075 --> 01:33:25.966
goes long.

01:33:25.966 --> 01:33:27.857
LAURA: Grog! Grog, no. No!

01:33:27.857 --> 01:33:32.816
TRAVIS: 20 on the first.

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:36.167
MATT: 20 points of damage. (impact noise) First
one didn't hit, did it?

01:33:36.167 --> 01:33:38.017
LAURA: The first one didn't hit, so you only get
the 20.

01:33:38.017 --> 01:33:39.136
TRAVIS: Oh, just the 20!

01:33:39.136 --> 01:33:43.046
MATT: Just 20, so as the first one misses, you
pull back, trying to stop him, but the hammer

01:33:43.046 --> 01:33:46.021
still slams you in the side; you don't have time
to move out of the way, and it pushes you up

01:33:46.021 --> 01:33:50.647
against the wall. You land on your feet, and you
can feel the pulsing of the blood broken beneath

01:33:50.647 --> 01:33:54.551
the skin. That ends Grog's go. Percy, you're up.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:34:02.146
TALIESIN: (gasps, sighs) "Hi!" I saw what just
happened, right?

01:34:02.164 --> 01:34:03.465
MATT: Yeah.

01:34:03.465 --> 01:34:04.894
TALIESIN: I'm going to try to fix my gun.

01:34:04.929 --> 01:34:06.407
MATT: Go for it.

01:34:06.407 --> 01:34:07.508
TALIESIN: That fixes.

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:08.450
MATT: All righty.

01:34:08.450 --> 01:34:20.343
TALIESIN: (sighs) Are you better? Good, then
let's deal with this. I'm going to start diving

01:34:20.343 --> 01:34:22.692
around the columns to get away from the wraith.

01:34:22.692 --> 01:34:23.713
MATT: Around here?

01:34:23.713 --> 01:34:25.131
TALIESIN: Yeah, because I don't have a shot this
round.

01:34:25.131 --> 01:34:27.666
MATT: Okay, so you move around that way.

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:28.523
TALIESIN: Yeah, cool.

01:34:28.523 --> 01:34:31.124
MATT: All right. That ends your turn?

01:34:31.124 --> 01:34:31.955
TALIESIN: That ends my turn.

01:34:31.955 --> 01:34:46.432
MATT: It's now their turn. This one currently
loses interest in you and drifts two, three, four,

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:53.618
five, six, seven, eight-- it (whoosh) passes
through the stone. Moves through and appears on

01:34:53.618 --> 01:34:56.580
the other side. I need you to make a charisma
saving throw.

01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:00.851
TALIESIN: I have advantage on charisma saving
throws right now, do I not?

01:35:00.851 --> 01:35:03.002
LAURA: Oh, yeah, because she cast--

01:35:03.002 --> 01:35:05.293
MARISHA: It's not there anymore. Sorry.

01:35:05.293 --> 01:35:08.317
MATT: Yeah. She dropped it when she picked up the
concentration spell.

01:35:08.317 --> 01:35:11.582
TRAVIS: Roll high, golden snitch.

01:35:11.582 --> 01:35:13.403
MATT: And that was ability checks, not saving
throws.

01:35:13.403 --> 01:35:22.765
TALIESIN: Oh, then never mind. What's my charisma
saving-- oh boy. Nope. I rolled a natural one. You

01:35:22.765 --> 01:35:25.472
did this! This is the third natural one. You
touched it.

01:35:25.472 --> 01:35:28.754
LAURA: That's why I'm superstitious about my
dice.

01:35:28.754 --> 01:35:29.925
MARISHA: I touched it.

01:35:29.925 --> 01:35:31.704
LAURA: He also touched mine, and I rolled a
three.

01:35:31.704 --> 01:35:34.739
TALIESIN: I'll come back to you after
Thanksgiving, baby.

01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:43.173
MATT: And with that, it goes dark and a spiritual
intent takes over your body. You feel like you're

01:35:43.173 --> 01:35:46.943
being puppeted, and you have no control over
yourself. You're hidden, captured within your own

01:35:46.943 --> 01:35:51.787
form. All right, that ends his turn. Vax, you're
up.

01:35:51.787 --> 01:35:52.758
LIAM: Okay.

01:35:52.758 --> 01:36:01.490
MATT: You still feel the residual warmth in your
glove pulsing.

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:12.284
LIAM: All right. I'm going to click my boots
together. I'm going to move towards him.

01:36:12.284 --> 01:36:14.585
MATT: Towards Percy?

01:36:14.585 --> 01:36:21.444
LIAM: Towards Percy. Shit. I'm going to take the
keen dagger and stick it into his gut, and I'm

01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:25.745
going to take the glove with the symbol of
Sarenrae and punch him in the nose.

01:36:25.745 --> 01:36:26.949
MATT: Okay.

01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:31.365
LAURA: I like that you're violent instead of just
going, "Healing hand."

01:36:31.365 --> 01:36:32.364
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:36:32.364 --> 01:36:33.821
LAURA: You go, "fuck you!"

01:36:33.821 --> 01:36:37.566
SAM: Can I just say, this is Percy beating up
Percy right now.

01:36:37.566 --> 01:36:40.354
(laughter)

01:36:40.354 --> 01:36:43.476
MATT: Yeah. You're being attacked and stabbed by
yourself. It's weird.

01:36:43.476 --> 01:36:44.547
LIAM: 20 for the dagger.

01:36:44.547 --> 01:36:46.749
TALIESIN: I'm not reading too much into this.

01:36:46.749 --> 01:36:47.846
MATT: That hits.

01:36:47.846 --> 01:36:52.405
LIAM: The punch is just strength modifier, right?

01:36:52.405 --> 01:36:53.653
TALIESIN: This is not a metaphor!

01:36:53.653 --> 01:36:55.115
LIAM: 17 for the punch.

01:36:55.115 --> 01:37:02.491
MATT: All right. Roll damage for the dagger.
What's your AC?

01:37:02.491 --> 01:37:03.413
TALIESIN: 18.

01:37:03.413 --> 01:37:04.625
MATT: 18. Okay.

01:37:04.625 --> 01:37:06.283
LIAM: Nine.

01:37:06.283 --> 01:37:10.914
MATT: You take nine points of piercing damage as
the dagger stabs into your stomach. As you swing

01:37:10.914 --> 01:37:14.891
to haul the punch off, the body ducks out of the
way.

01:37:14.891 --> 01:37:16.426
MARISHA: Take the punch!

01:37:16.426 --> 01:37:18.101
MATT: All right. That ends your turn.

01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:19.613
LIAM: Wait. How far did I go?

01:37:19.613 --> 01:37:25.787
MATT: You were there, so that's 15 feet.

01:37:25.787 --> 01:37:28.655
LIAM: I want to spring back and run as far as I
can in the other direction, around the corner

01:37:28.655 --> 01:37:30.185
towards the rest.

01:37:30.185 --> 01:37:37.095
MATT: All right. That brings us to Scanlan.

01:37:37.095 --> 01:37:48.593
SAM: I walk between Grog and Keyleth, maintaining
my 15-foot distance. Even more between.

01:37:48.593 --> 01:37:50.252
MATT: There?

01:37:50.252 --> 01:37:54.495
SAM: Yeah, and I'll Thunderwave them both. Oh no,
and I hit Trinket.

01:37:54.495 --> 01:37:58.136
(laughter)

01:37:58.136 --> 01:38:05.516
MATT: All right. Constitution saving throw from
Grog and Keyleth and Trinket.

01:38:05.516 --> 01:38:09.636
TRAVIS: Do we roll something?

01:38:09.636 --> 01:38:10.754
LAURA: Yeah.

01:38:10.754 --> 01:38:11.723
MATT: What did you roll?

01:38:11.723 --> 01:38:12.722
MARISHA: 12.

01:38:12.722 --> 01:38:15.255
MATT: (thud) Grog?

01:38:15.255 --> 01:38:16.455
TRAVIS: I rolled an 18.

01:38:16.455 --> 01:38:18.593
MATT: What's your DC?

01:38:18.593 --> 01:38:20.089
SAM: 19.

01:38:20.089 --> 01:38:22.619
MATT: All right, so roll damage. What's
Trinket's?

01:38:22.619 --> 01:38:25.230
LAURA: You have a constitution saving throw of
eight.

01:38:25.230 --> 01:38:26.706
TRAVIS: Oh. 26.

01:38:26.706 --> 01:38:27.824
MATT: Okay, so you take half damage.

01:38:27.824 --> 01:38:30.563
LAURA: Trinket rolled an 11.

01:38:30.563 --> 01:38:32.793
MATT: Okay. (thud)

01:38:32.793 --> 01:38:37.000
SAM: Eight points of damage.

01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:40.621
MATT: Okay, so you take eight points of damage.
Grog takes four. Trinket takes eight.

01:38:40.621 --> 01:38:47.951
SAM: Are we trying to kill our friends, here?

01:38:47.951 --> 01:38:49.116
TRAVIS: Yeah, get us.

01:38:49.116 --> 01:38:51.825
LAURA: Get them unconscious so they come out. But
then if they're unconscious, the ghosts come out

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.847
and they could possess us.

01:38:53.847 --> 01:38:55.342
SAM: That's great.

01:38:55.342 --> 01:38:57.413
MARISHA: But they take radiant damage.

01:38:57.413 --> 01:39:00.677
MATT: Keyleth, top of the turn, roll--

01:39:00.677 --> 01:39:03.358
MARISHA: Did I get radiant damage from that push?

01:39:03.358 --> 01:39:04.246
SAM: No.

01:39:04.246 --> 01:39:06.294
MATT: You take 3d8 points of radiant damage.

01:39:06.294 --> 01:39:07.315
MARISHA: Oh, I do.

01:39:07.315 --> 01:39:15.318
SAM: From the spirit guardians. Oh, and I'll also
inspire Vax. (sings) Rip out someone's tongue

01:39:15.318 --> 01:39:21.741
and I'll know you. Cure someone dead and I'll show
you've got those moves with dagger. You've got

01:39:21.741 --> 01:39:23.812
those moves with dagger. You've got those--

01:39:23.857 --> 01:39:26.989
ALL: (sings) Moves like dagger.

01:39:26.989 --> 01:39:31.725
SAM: Okay. 13.

01:39:31.725 --> 01:39:41.679
MATT: All right, so 13 points of radiant damage to
you and to... okay.

01:39:41.679 --> 01:39:45.741
MARISHA: 62 hit points.

01:39:45.741 --> 01:39:49.606
MATT: All right. Scanlan, that's your turn.
Keyleth.

01:39:49.606 --> 01:39:50.748
MARISHA: Yeah?

01:39:50.748 --> 01:39:57.148
MATT: You turn around as you see Vax rush up with
a look of fear and intensity on his face. You see

01:39:57.148 --> 01:40:02.290
her turn around with this twisted grin on her
face, and she brings her staff up and swings it

01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.075
towards your head. Roll an attack.

01:40:04.075 --> 01:40:09.238
MARISHA: (whoosh) Baseball. 17.

01:40:09.238 --> 01:40:10.608
MATT: What's your AC?

01:40:10.608 --> 01:40:12.515
LIAM: It is 18.

01:40:12.515 --> 01:40:16.641
MATT: 18. As she swings, you duck, and her staff
(impact noise) smacks against the stone wall of

01:40:16.641 --> 01:40:23.629
the mausoleum. That ends your turn, bringing us to
Vex.

01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:27.371
LAURA: And I'm in a fight with Grog.

01:40:27.371 --> 01:40:28.350
MATT: Correct.

01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:34.376
LAURA: Okay. This is totally awesome.

01:40:34.376 --> 01:40:37.882
SAM: Wait! We have Cass. Does she get a turn?

01:40:37.882 --> 01:40:39.715
LAURA: She's not doing anything.

01:40:39.715 --> 01:40:42.272
MATT: I forgot to add her to the initiative.
That's my own fault.

01:40:42.272 --> 01:40:43.871
LAURA: I just thought she was being a bitch.

01:40:43.871 --> 01:40:47.337
MATT: I'll give her a couple of rounds here in a
second. Anyway, finish up.

01:40:47.337 --> 01:40:53.180
LAURA: Trinket runs forward and tries to pull
Grog's focus so that I can back away.

01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:59.752
MATT: Okay, so Trinket moves up to there.

01:40:59.752 --> 01:41:03.509
LAURA: He tries to grapple him, or something. Can
he do anything to make Grog not be able to attack

01:41:03.509 --> 01:41:09.949
me if I run away? Can he try to knock him down, or
something? Jump up on his back and knock him

01:41:09.949 --> 01:41:11.176
over.

01:41:11.176 --> 01:41:16.149
MATT: Use an action to make a trip attack. Sure,
why not. Roll an athletics check.

01:41:16.149 --> 01:41:19.495
LAURA: Okay. Yeah, no problem.

01:41:19.495 --> 01:41:21.636
TALIESIN: I'm imagining a bear doing mild
calisthenics.

01:41:21.636 --> 01:41:25.077
LAURA: An athletics check for me?

01:41:25.077 --> 01:41:26.244
MATT: No, for Trinket.

01:41:26.244 --> 01:41:28.961
LAURA: Okay. 12?

01:41:28.961 --> 01:41:31.108
MATT: Make a strength saving throw, Grog.

01:41:31.108 --> 01:41:36.020
TRAVIS: That's a 26.

01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:41.594
MATT: Yeah, Trinket rushes over and tries to knock
you off your feet, and you just (thud) no effect.

01:41:41.594 --> 01:41:44.411
You still have a bonus action and your movement,
if you want to.

01:41:44.411 --> 01:41:50.329
LAURA: I'm going to try to roll out of the way.
I'm going to try to duck down and roll out of the

01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:53.350
way to make him less likely to hit me.

01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:57.887
SAM: Yeah! The old "less likely" trick.

01:41:57.887 --> 01:42:00.146
MATT: Make an acrobatics check.

01:42:00.146 --> 01:42:03.809
LAURA: Okay. Oh, my dice suck tonight!

01:42:03.809 --> 01:42:05.041
SAM: You're inspired.

01:42:05.041 --> 01:42:07.606
MARISHA: He's sucking up all the good energy.

01:42:07.606 --> 01:42:13.251
LAURA: That's good! Acrobatics. 28.

01:42:13.251 --> 01:42:19.594
MATT: 28? Grog, roll an attack with disadvantage,
just for the hell of it.

01:42:19.594 --> 01:42:24.938
TRAVIS: 23.

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:28.007
MATT: Okay, roll damage against Vex as she pulls
away from you.

01:42:28.007 --> 01:42:31.951
TRAVIS: The first one was a natural 20.

01:42:31.951 --> 01:42:34.417
MATT: Be glad it was disadvantage.

01:42:34.417 --> 01:42:37.950
TRAVIS: 21.

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:43.568
MATT: You take 21 points of bludgeoning damage. As
you pull away, Grog (whack) backhands you with his

01:42:43.568 --> 01:42:47.013
hammer. Now you can take your bonus action, if you
want to.

01:42:47.013 --> 01:42:53.179
LAURA: As my bonus action, I'm going to cast--

01:42:53.179 --> 01:42:57.281
TRAVIS: Kill Goliath.

01:42:57.281 --> 01:43:02.163
LAURA: Right? I don't want to use any of my shit!

01:43:02.163 --> 01:43:04.026
TRAVIS: Can you conjure a keg of beer?

01:43:04.026 --> 01:43:06.408
SAM: That would distract you.

01:43:06.408 --> 01:43:13.879
LAURA: I can't, but that's a really good idea. For
my bonus action, I'm going to go, help!

01:43:13.879 --> 01:43:17.493
SAM: You can use your bonus action to throw me the
gun!

01:43:17.493 --> 01:43:20.467
LAURA: Oh. No.

01:43:20.467 --> 01:43:28.208
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Cassandra is
going to rush up angrily with her shortsword out.

01:43:28.208 --> 01:43:40.973
Rushing up behind Grog, she's going to make a
strike. That is going to be 18.

01:43:40.973 --> 01:43:42.270
What's your armor class?

01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:43.061
TRAVIS: 19.

01:43:43.061 --> 01:43:46.981
MATT: 19. She goes to strike and whiffs,
unfortunately. She's going to attack with her

01:43:46.981 --> 01:43:54.679
dagger she pulls out in her off hand. Rolls a
three. Yeah. I'm giving her a second round because

01:43:54.679 --> 01:43:58.577
I missed the one. She's going to angrily pull up
again and attempt to strike with both a second

01:43:58.577 --> 01:44:01.102
time. That will be a 20.

01:44:01.102 --> 01:44:02.103
TRAVIS: That hits.

01:44:02.103 --> 01:44:06.631
MATT: All righty. Because Trinket is adjacent, she
gets sneak attack damage.

01:44:06.631 --> 01:44:09.082
LAURA: Yay! Oh, she's a rogue.

01:44:09.082 --> 01:44:10.283
LIAM: Rogue.

01:44:10.283 --> 01:44:24.873
MATT: So you take 27 points of piercing damage.
Well, it's slashing damage from the shortsword.

01:44:24.873 --> 01:44:29.240
The offhand attack is another three. Going to
miss.

01:44:29.240 --> 01:44:30.404
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:44:30.404 --> 01:44:40.906
MATT: All righty. That brings us to Grog. Roll
another d20.

01:44:40.906 --> 01:44:46.442
TRAVIS: 11.

01:44:46.442 --> 01:44:52.352
MATT: 11. Your attention switches to Cassandra.
Roll two attacks.

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:55.752
SAM: Do I get my radiant damage on him?

01:44:55.752 --> 01:45:00.023
MATT: At the top of his turn, you do, yeah.
Actually, before that happens, roll radiant

01:45:00.023 --> 01:45:00.989
damage.

01:45:00.989 --> 01:45:02.327
SAM: 21.

01:45:02.327 --> 01:45:04.710
TRAVIS: 21 points?

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:11.570
MATT: With that, as you're reeling up your hammer
to strike Cassandra, a burst of radiant energy

01:45:11.608 --> 01:45:16.865
disintegrates the ghostly presence within your
body, and you find your mind come to you as you're

01:45:16.865 --> 01:45:22.405
about to go into a downswing to smash Cassandra's
head in. You catch yourself.

01:45:22.405 --> 01:45:23.711
SAM: Do it anyway, Grog!

01:45:23.711 --> 01:45:25.408
(laughter)

01:45:25.408 --> 01:45:26.585
MARISHA: Don't!

01:45:26.585 --> 01:45:28.151
SAM: She's one of us.

01:45:28.151 --> 01:45:29.705
MATT: You have your turn now.

01:45:29.705 --> 01:45:30.997
TRAVIS: Oh, I have my turn?

01:45:30.997 --> 01:45:31.819
MATT: Yes.

01:45:31.819 --> 01:45:36.950
SAM: Grog, I know you don't know what's going on
right now, but kill Keyleth!

01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:41.805
TRAVIS: Okay. I turn and walk over to Keyleth.

01:45:41.805 --> 01:45:43.528
MATT: Over Cassandra.

01:45:43.528 --> 01:45:44.775
TALIESIN: Poor Cass.

01:45:44.775 --> 01:45:48.911
TRAVIS: I'm going to swing my hammer at the middle
of her chest.

01:45:48.911 --> 01:45:53.995
SAM: Oh, you're scary. She's so cute.

01:45:53.995 --> 01:45:56.025
TRAVIS: 15.

01:45:56.025 --> 01:45:57.957
MATT: What's your AC, Keyleth?

01:45:57.957 --> 01:45:58.982
MARISHA: 18.

01:45:58.982 --> 01:46:02.167
MATT: She ducks out of the way with this
preternatural speed.

01:46:02.167 --> 01:46:05.584
TRAVIS: Wow. 16.

01:46:05.584 --> 01:46:08.434
MARISHA: (cackles)

01:46:08.434 --> 01:46:13.730
MATT: Keyleth's ghostly form is too fast for you.
The confusion of the whole sequence caused you to

01:46:13.730 --> 01:46:18.597
not be able to think straight in the moment, and
you miss twice. That ends your turn, Grog. Percy.

01:46:18.597 --> 01:46:21.956
LAURA: Oh, right. Percy's still--

01:46:21.956 --> 01:46:23.817
SAM: Jesus. And he's got guns.

01:46:23.817 --> 01:46:25.170
MATT: Your gun was just fixed, correct?

01:46:25.170 --> 01:46:26.462
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:46:26.462 --> 01:46:28.452
(laughter)

01:46:28.452 --> 01:46:32.282
TALIESIN: Would he use the gun or the sword in
phantom mode?

01:46:32.282 --> 01:46:38.242
MATT: You just finished fixing this, and you have
a gun before you. It's going to use it. Make three

01:46:38.242 --> 01:46:40.995
attacks against Vex-- Vax. I mean Vax.

01:46:40.995 --> 01:46:43.503
TALIESIN: I'm going to use this die, because it's
been--

01:46:43.503 --> 01:46:46.383
MARISHA: Failing? Yeah, I touched it. Use the one
that I touched.

01:46:46.383 --> 01:46:54.731
TALIESIN: That's-- I can't talk. 21.

01:46:54.731 --> 01:46:59.544
LIAM: That hits, but what's applicable? Uncanny
Dodge or Evasion for a gunshot?

01:46:59.581 --> 01:47:06.612
MATT: Whatever reduces the damage to half. It's
not a saving throw, so it would be-- which one

01:47:06.612 --> 01:47:08.026
reduces the damage by half?

01:47:08.061 --> 01:47:09.338
LIAM: That's Uncanny Dodge.

01:47:09.338 --> 01:47:12.856
MATT: Then it would be Uncanny Dodge. All right,
so attack two more times.

01:47:12.856 --> 01:47:15.309
TALIESIN: 21.

01:47:15.309 --> 01:47:17.194
MATT: Hits. And?

01:47:17.194 --> 01:47:20.684
TALIESIN: 26.

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:23.348
MATT: All right, so roll damage three times. The
first one is halved.

01:47:23.348 --> 01:47:29.993
TALIESIN: All right. 13.

01:47:29.993 --> 01:47:32.125
MATT: So you take seven damage.

01:47:32.125 --> 01:47:35.321
TALIESIN: Fuck me. 15.

01:47:35.321 --> 01:47:37.109
MATT: 15 piercing damage.

01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:38.471
TALIESIN: And 11.

01:47:38.471 --> 01:47:42.918
MATT: Okay. (three gunshots)

01:47:42.918 --> 01:47:46.497
SAM: We are so strong! We should never fight
ourselves.

01:47:46.497 --> 01:47:58.402
MATT: All right. That ends Percy's turn there.
Vax, you're up.

01:47:58.402 --> 01:48:04.191
LIAM: Am I able to slide around Keyleth closer to
you, into that little alcove, or am I too pressed

01:48:04.191 --> 01:48:06.790
against the wall? The other way.

01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:10.655
MATT: Currently, it's just enemies, so you can't
move past them.

01:48:10.655 --> 01:48:11.879
LIAM: Okay.

01:48:11.879 --> 01:48:13.939
MATT: I could make you roll an acrobatics check,
if you wanted.

01:48:13.939 --> 01:48:16.791
LIAM: That's all right. I flip the daggers over,
and I start to whale on

01:48:16.791 --> 01:48:18.076
the back of Keyleth's head.

01:48:18.076 --> 01:48:18.843
MATT: Okay.

01:48:18.843 --> 01:48:20.095
LIAM: Pommels of the daggers.

01:48:20.095 --> 01:48:21.921
SAM: Kiss or kill.

01:48:21.921 --> 01:48:25.883
LIAM: 18.

01:48:25.883 --> 01:48:29.650
MATT: Are you doing sneak attack on this? She's
adjacent to Grog, so yeah.

01:48:29.650 --> 01:48:30.794
LIAM: Definitely.

01:48:30.794 --> 01:48:31.873
MATT: 18 hits.

01:48:31.873 --> 01:48:36.760
LIAM: Second one is 20.

01:48:36.760 --> 01:48:39.156
MARISHA: Hits.

01:48:39.156 --> 01:48:41.276
MATT: They both hit, so roll damage on both.

01:48:41.276 --> 01:48:42.752
LIAM: And then 32 on the last.

01:48:42.752 --> 01:48:45.547
MATT: Oh, that's right. So three hits, with sneak
attack.

01:48:45.547 --> 01:48:47.877
MARISHA: Oh, sneak attack is going to take me
down.

01:48:47.877 --> 01:48:57.514
LIAM: Three. Plus seven is ten. And the ten gets
doubled? Or everything?

01:48:57.514 --> 01:48:59.147
MARISHA: Dice rolls get doubled.

01:48:59.147 --> 01:49:03.985
LIAM: Ten, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 50.

01:49:03.985 --> 01:49:05.324
SAM: 50?

01:49:05.324 --> 01:49:06.698
LIAM: 50 for the first hit.

01:49:06.698 --> 01:49:08.584
MARISHA: (laughs) I'm still alive.

01:49:08.584 --> 01:49:10.054
MATT: Was it doubled because you rolled a
critical?

01:49:10.054 --> 01:49:11.365
MARISHA: Sneak Attack.

01:49:11.365 --> 01:49:12.950
MATT: Sneak Attack, you just roll the dice.

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:14.019
LIAM: Well, then no. 25.

01:49:14.019 --> 01:49:14.828
MATT: 25.

01:49:14.828 --> 01:49:16.005
LIAM: Thank you.

01:49:16.005 --> 01:49:16.890
MATT: No worries.

01:49:16.890 --> 01:49:19.016
LIAM: Plus nine, plus nine.

01:49:19.016 --> 01:49:21.184
MATT: Okay, so 25 plus 18...

01:49:21.184 --> 01:49:22.348
LIAM: 38.

01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:23.592
MARISHA: 38? Okay.

01:49:23.592 --> 01:49:27.656
MATT: 25 plus 18 is 43.

01:49:27.656 --> 01:49:30.357
MARISHA: 43?

01:49:30.357 --> 01:49:31.539
MATT: Yep.

01:49:31.539 --> 01:49:32.713
MARISHA: What was I at just now?

01:49:32.713 --> 01:49:34.441
SAM: 62. So you're at 19.

01:49:34.441 --> 01:49:35.597
MARISHA: 19 hit points.

01:49:35.597 --> 01:49:41.847
LIAM: I'm going to use-- I don't care. I'm going
to slide around Grog, to the side. Towards

01:49:41.847 --> 01:49:44.423
Scanlan. Right there, yeah.

01:49:44.423 --> 01:49:45.559
MATT: Okay.

01:49:45.559 --> 01:49:47.608
SAM: What's up, brother?

01:49:47.608 --> 01:49:53.473
MATT: All right, that ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up.

01:49:53.473 --> 01:49:54.947
SAM: I'm up again?

01:49:54.947 --> 01:49:56.100
MATT: Yep.

01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:02.978
SAM: I feel like I just went. All right. We're
trying to kill our friends, right?

01:50:02.978 --> 01:50:03.945
LIAM: Yes.

01:50:03.945 --> 01:50:09.086
SAM: Okay. Thank you for moving, Vax. I'm going to
blast them both with lightning. Straight shot

01:50:09.086 --> 01:50:10.456
through, 100 feet.

01:50:10.456 --> 01:50:15.161
MATT: Through those two? Yeah. Okay.

01:50:15.161 --> 01:50:19.204
SAM: Yeah. What do I do? 8d6?

01:50:19.204 --> 01:50:23.177
MATT: 8d6, and I need Keyleth and Percy to both
make dexterity saving throws.

01:50:23.177 --> 01:50:29.206
MARISHA: Just the two of us? I actually have
disadvantage on dexterity stuff because of

01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:35.503
corruption. 20 for me.

01:50:35.503 --> 01:50:36.700
TALIESIN: 21.

01:50:36.700 --> 01:50:38.152
MATT: You both take half damage.

01:50:38.152 --> 01:50:39.206
SAM: 24.

01:50:39.206 --> 01:50:45.469
MATT: You both take 12 points of lightning damage.
The bolt strikes through, hitting both of you in

01:50:45.469 --> 01:50:48.240
the chest, but you both manage to pull out of the
way just in time to reduce the

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.473
impact of the spell.

01:50:49.473 --> 01:50:58.830
SAM: And as a bonus action, I'll do a Healing Word
on Vex. Right? You're injured badly?

01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:02.219
LAURA: I mean, not badly, but--

01:51:02.219 --> 01:51:07.686
SAM: Oh, well then fuck it. Oh, you're injured
badly? Would I know that?

01:51:07.726 --> 01:51:11.686
MATT: You could glance over and look at him as he
pulls up to you, and see him (pants).

01:51:11.736 --> 01:51:13.259
LIAM: I've got gunshots in my back.

01:51:13.259 --> 01:51:17.324
SAM: Okay. Yeah, so I'll Healing Word.

01:51:17.324 --> 01:51:19.114
MATT: Roll the healing points for that.

01:51:19.114 --> 01:51:27.109
SAM: What is it? Shit. It's right here: d4 plus
five. That's it?! So lame. Seven points.

01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:31.226
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Keyleth, at
the top of your turn, roll 3d8 radiant damage.

01:51:31.226 --> 01:51:34.343
SAM: Ooh, yes. Oh, this is going to knock you
out.

01:51:34.343 --> 01:51:35.556
MARISHA: Hopefully.

01:51:35.556 --> 01:51:41.036
SAM: That's nine already.

01:51:41.036 --> 01:51:42.075
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm down.

01:51:42.075 --> 01:51:44.936
SAM: Six more is 15.

01:51:44.936 --> 01:51:52.243
MATT: Keyleth falls unconscious to the ground as
this blast of radiant energy bursts around her as

01:51:52.243 --> 01:51:56.799
this spiritual radiant form that's been
surrounding the area and stalking the various

01:51:56.799 --> 01:52:03.421
individuals. It slams into her form. As she
collapses, the ghost is jettisoned from her body

01:52:03.421 --> 01:52:08.262
and looks like it's been taking the radiant damage
and is having a hard time keeping its corporeal

01:52:08.262 --> 01:52:15.145
form. All right, that ends Keyleth's turn.
Keyleth, I need you to roll a death saving throw.

01:52:15.145 --> 01:52:17.786
MARISHA: Nope. Six.

01:52:17.786 --> 01:52:22.786
MATT: You take one death saving throw failure. All
right. Vex, you're up.

01:52:22.786 --> 01:52:31.576
LAURA: I see the ghost come out of her? Okay, I'm
going to shoot it with my Blazing Bowstring.

01:52:31.576 --> 01:52:33.071
MATT: Okay.

01:52:33.071 --> 01:52:40.050
LAURA: 16?

01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:41.558
MATT: 16 hits.

01:52:41.558 --> 01:52:57.647
LAURA: 17. I want a good one. 17. 25.

01:52:57.647 --> 01:53:02.122
MATT: 25. As you pull back the arrow and you see
the flames ignite around the shaft, you release

01:53:02.122 --> 01:53:08.586
it. It slams into the ghost, and you see its form
(raspy cry) disperse from the impact, the arrow

01:53:08.586 --> 01:53:12.676
hitting the wall behind it and shattering against
the stone. Ghost destroyed.

01:53:12.676 --> 01:53:17.816
LAURA: For my second attack, I'm going to attack
Percy. Can I see him?

01:53:17.816 --> 01:53:19.181
MATT: Yep, right over there.

01:53:19.181 --> 01:53:22.930
LAURA: All right, I'm going to do it. 21.

01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:24.187
MATT: 21 hits.

01:53:24.187 --> 01:53:27.981
TALIESIN: (ghost noises)

01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:28.974
LAURA: 16.

01:53:28.974 --> 01:53:30.803
MATT: 16 points of damage to you, Percy.

01:53:30.803 --> 01:53:32.071
TALIESIN: 16?

01:53:32.071 --> 01:53:32.981
MATT: Yep.

01:53:32.981 --> 01:53:33.712
TALIESIN: Cool.

01:53:33.712 --> 01:53:35.413
LAURA: That was also through my Blazing
Bowstring.

01:53:35.413 --> 01:53:37.881
MATT: So you're using both Blazing Bowstring
abilities right now?

01:53:37.881 --> 01:53:38.715
LAURA: Yeah.

01:53:38.715 --> 01:53:42.860
MATT: Okay. A flaming arrow (impact noise) sticks
into the shoulder, and you can feel the flames

01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.122
burning into your body--

01:53:44.122 --> 01:53:46.468
LAURA: Plus another five. That was another five
burning damage.

01:53:46.468 --> 01:53:47.251
TRAVIS: 21.

01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:48.174
TALIESIN: 21?

01:53:48.174 --> 01:53:49.592
MATT: There you go.

01:53:49.592 --> 01:53:51.578
TALIESIN: I'm still doing fine.

01:53:51.578 --> 01:53:52.984
MARISHA: I hate these things.

01:53:52.984 --> 01:53:57.523
MATT: It's now Cass's turn. Cass, who's having a
weird time with the whole process of seeing a

01:53:57.523 --> 01:54:00.631
bunch of herselves and her brothers stabbing each
other and getting possessed.

01:54:00.631 --> 01:54:01.922
LAURA: How do we even know who's who?

01:54:01.922 --> 01:54:03.313
MARISHA: Stop hitting yourself!

01:54:03.313 --> 01:54:09.865
TALIESIN: Thank you for that. I was almost going
there.

01:54:09.865 --> 01:54:13.145
MATT: She's right there, and she brings herself
around the way. She's not able to do any actions,

01:54:13.145 --> 01:54:20.247
so she sees another of her brothers possessed but
clutching the gun in the hand, and is steeling her

01:54:20.247 --> 01:54:23.868
blade for the moment and doesn't do anything with
her turn. Grog, you're up.

01:54:23.936 --> 01:54:27.187
TRAVIS: "Percy!" And I run towards him.

01:54:27.187 --> 01:54:34.736
TALIESIN: (creepy voice) I'll swallow your soul!

01:54:34.736 --> 01:54:36.456
TRAVIS: 25.

01:54:36.456 --> 01:54:39.100
TALIESIN: Is no one a Sam Raimi fan? Never mind.

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:40.601
SAM: That was Donald Duck, right?

01:54:40.601 --> 01:54:41.619
TRAVIS: 18?

01:54:41.619 --> 01:54:43.042
MATT: What's your armor class?

01:54:43.042 --> 01:54:43.902
TALIESIN: 18.

01:54:43.902 --> 01:54:45.436
MATT: Yeah, hits. Damage on both.

01:54:45.436 --> 01:54:55.714
TRAVIS: 17 for the first one. 19 for the second
one.

01:54:55.714 --> 01:55:05.556
MATT: Okay, so 36 points of damage. (two impacts)
You're thrown up against the wall and almost

01:55:05.556 --> 01:55:08.708
pushed over off your feet from the sheer weight of
the impact.

01:55:08.708 --> 01:55:10.411
TALIESIN: It has to be magic damage, though.

01:55:10.411 --> 01:55:11.779
LAURA: It was. It's a magic war hammer.

01:55:11.779 --> 01:55:15.516
TALIESIN: Okay, so it's taking damage, too. That's
good. Maybe.

01:55:15.516 --> 01:55:16.999
MARISHA: They have to be spells.

01:55:16.999 --> 01:55:18.453
TRAVIS: There was fire damage.

01:55:18.453 --> 01:55:26.652
MATT: Yeah. It seems that the radiant damage from
the Spirit Guardian spell you're doing has been

01:55:26.652 --> 01:55:31.250
doing the bulk of damage to them while they're
inside the form. Most everything else is going

01:55:31.250 --> 01:55:32.674
straight to the individual.

01:55:32.674 --> 01:55:34.109
TRAVIS and SAM: Oh shit!

01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:36.753
SAM: We've just been killing our friends for no
reason?

01:55:36.753 --> 01:55:38.078
LAURA: Good times.

01:55:38.078 --> 01:55:40.970
TRAVIS: Let's pass our--

01:55:40.970 --> 01:55:42.762
SAM: Hold our wrath.

01:55:42.762 --> 01:55:48.068
MATT: Percy. You have three more shots with this
gun, two of which are magical.

01:55:48.068 --> 01:55:49.366
TALIESIN: I do.

01:55:49.366 --> 01:55:53.855
MATT: So you pull up the gun, you take a step
back.

01:55:53.855 --> 01:55:57.785
TALIESIN: Does he get an attack of opportunity?

01:55:57.785 --> 01:56:01.319
MATT: You do. Attack of opportunity against Percy,
if you want to take it.

01:56:01.319 --> 01:56:02.555
MARISHA: Come on, take him down.

01:56:02.555 --> 01:56:04.007
LAURA: Oh no!

01:56:04.007 --> 01:56:05.324
TRAVIS: That's a natural 20.

01:56:05.324 --> 01:56:06.218
TALIESIN: Yes!

01:56:06.218 --> 01:56:07.265
MATT: Roll damage.

01:56:07.265 --> 01:56:11.216
TRAVIS: That's actually the first time I've
critted on this show.

01:56:11.216 --> 01:56:13.377
MATT: You get additional dice.

01:56:13.377 --> 01:56:14.753
TRAVIS: It does additional damage.

01:56:14.753 --> 01:56:16.868
MATT: It's the first time you've critically hit on
this show?

01:56:16.868 --> 01:56:18.185
TRAVIS: I think so, because I've never doubled my
dice.

01:56:18.185 --> 01:56:19.812
MATT: That's absurd.

01:56:19.812 --> 01:56:22.770
TRAVIS: I know. 14.

01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:24.571
TALIESIN: 14? I'm already out.

01:56:24.571 --> 01:56:26.765
MATT: Roll damage. I want to know what it is.

01:56:26.765 --> 01:56:28.858
TALIESIN: Yeah, go ahead, but I'm out.

01:56:28.858 --> 01:56:35.948
TRAVIS: 18, so-- what was the first one? 18 and?

01:56:35.948 --> 01:56:37.085
MARISHA: You said 14.

01:56:37.085 --> 01:56:43.154
MATT: Okay. You are out. Percy falls to the
ground, unconscious. The spirit is jettisoned out

01:56:43.154 --> 01:56:52.670
the side. That ends your turn entirely. The ghost
is going to shift over. It does not get its

01:56:52.670 --> 01:56:54.186
possession back.

01:56:54.186 --> 01:56:58.284
TALIESIN: It was just a crit. It wasn't hit
twice.

01:56:58.284 --> 01:57:00.079
MARISHA: It wasn't when he was down.

01:57:00.079 --> 01:57:03.866
MATT: Percy, I need you to make a death saving
throw, by the way.

01:57:03.866 --> 01:57:06.105
TALIESIN: Yay!

01:57:06.105 --> 01:57:13.393
MATT: Okay. The ghost gets pushed out of the body.
With you on the ground and its possession not

01:57:13.393 --> 01:57:16.151
returned, it reaches down and strikes at you with
its withering touch.

01:57:16.151 --> 01:57:17.359
TALIESIN: Oh, for the love of--

01:57:17.359 --> 01:57:18.491
MARISHA: With its withering touch?

01:57:18.491 --> 01:57:21.797
MATT: You take two death saving throw losses.

01:57:21.797 --> 01:57:23.088
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:57:23.088 --> 01:57:24.199
LAURA: He rolled a crit?

01:57:24.199 --> 01:57:25.770
MATT: It's an auto-crit because he's unconscious.

01:57:25.770 --> 01:57:27.665
LAURA: Oh, jeez Louise!

01:57:27.665 --> 01:57:29.444
MARISHA: But you passed your first one.

01:57:29.444 --> 01:57:30.676
TALIESIN: I passed my first one.

01:57:30.676 --> 01:57:31.846
MARISHA: So you have two failures on you?

01:57:31.846 --> 01:57:38.090
TALIESIN: I have two failures and one success. So
guys? Heal me. Heal me now.

01:57:38.090 --> 01:57:39.702
MATT: Vax, you're up.

01:57:39.702 --> 01:57:48.042
LIAM: I start sprinting around that open hallway
near Cassandra. I stop by Cassandra and dagger,

01:57:48.042 --> 01:57:49.661
dagger, dagger.

01:57:49.661 --> 01:57:51.154
MATT: Do it.

01:57:51.154 --> 01:57:57.445
LIAM: First one is 30. Second one is 15. Third is
28.

01:57:57.445 --> 01:57:58.895
MATT: All three hit.

01:57:58.895 --> 01:58:10.867
LIAM: They all hit? Good. Ten plus seven is 17. 27
total.

01:58:10.867 --> 01:58:13.342
MATT: 27 damage, total?

01:58:13.342 --> 01:58:14.447
LIAM: All magic.

01:58:14.447 --> 01:58:19.083
MATT: All righty, so all daggers strike through
its form. You see it tearing through its ethereal

01:58:19.083 --> 01:58:22.905
physicality, but it's still holding its form
together. It looks damaged, but it's still holding

01:58:22.905 --> 01:58:26.223
its form on this plane. Scanlan, you're up.

01:58:26.223 --> 01:58:29.767
SAM: I vault over Keyleth--

01:58:29.767 --> 01:58:34.820
LIAM: Wait. I ran 20 feet? 30 feet?

01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:39.421
MATT: You were here, so 35.

01:58:39.421 --> 01:58:42.400
LIAM: 35? Can I run the "west" of the way--

01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:44.122
LAURA: The "west" of the way?

01:58:44.122 --> 01:58:48.838
LIAM: The "west" of the way through it in front of
Percy. Yeah.

01:58:48.838 --> 01:58:50.320
MATT: There? You can, yeah.

01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:51.587
LIAM: That's what I want to do.

01:58:51.587 --> 01:58:54.955
MATT: All right. Scanlan?

01:58:54.955 --> 01:59:04.179
SAM: I vault over Keyleth's body, using the right
part of a buttcheek to launch off. Grab a little

01:59:04.179 --> 01:59:05.691
feel as I go.

01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:07.182
MATT: Creepy gnome.

01:59:07.182 --> 01:59:10.569
SAM: I try to get within 15 feet of the thing.

01:59:10.569 --> 01:59:11.914
MATT: Okay.

01:59:11.914 --> 01:59:25.753
SAM: And as my first thing, I will Healing Word
Mr. Taliesin Jaffe. Percival de Rolo de Monico de

01:59:25.753 --> 01:59:27.350
Chico...

01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:29.317
TALIESIN: (sings) It's delightful, it's
de-lovely.

01:59:29.317 --> 01:59:37.954
SAM: Just at normal level, so that's nine points.

01:59:37.954 --> 01:59:39.719
TALIESIN: Thank you!

01:59:39.719 --> 01:59:41.255
MATT: Your death saving throws are fine.

01:59:41.255 --> 01:59:44.239
TALIESIN: Nine. Nine points! Ah-ah-ah.

01:59:44.239 --> 01:59:48.951
SAM: Jesus. I don't want to burn another fucking
thing on this guy.

01:59:48.951 --> 01:59:55.816
TALIESIN: Your aura thingy with 15 feet should do
it.

01:59:55.816 --> 02:00:02.623
SAM: I know, but that's when he moves, not when I
move, so I will mock him! I will say, you're not

02:00:02.623 --> 02:00:13.219
even corporeal. You have no substance. You're a
nothing. You're a nobody! You won't amount to

02:00:13.219 --> 02:00:14.779
nothing in this world!

02:00:14.779 --> 02:00:17.957
(laughter)

02:00:17.957 --> 02:00:20.948
MATT: Okay.

02:00:20.948 --> 02:00:23.111
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're a nothing. You're a
nobody!

02:00:23.111 --> 02:00:24.800
MATT: What's the DC on that?

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.229
SAM: 19.

02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:29.470
MATT: It fails its save. Roll 3d4.

02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:31.922
MARISHA: Kill it, Scanlan. Kill it.

02:00:31.922 --> 02:00:35.083
SAM: Six.

02:00:35.133 --> 02:00:36.722
MATT: (laughing) How do you want to do this?

02:00:36.722 --> 02:00:38.577
(cheers and laughter)

02:00:38.577 --> 02:00:40.112
TRAVIS: A mocking kill!

02:00:40.112 --> 02:00:44.929
SAM: (giggles) I would like it to cry. That's
all.

02:00:44.929 --> 02:00:50.031
MATT: (laughs) As you're shouting this, you can
see its ghostly form. Its face suddenly shifts

02:00:50.031 --> 02:00:53.747
into the face of a person.

02:00:53.747 --> 02:00:56.176
SAM: You were nothing in life, and now you're
nothing in death!

02:00:56.176 --> 02:01:02.624
MATT: It recalls its memories. You can see its
physical form become that of a young adult wearing

02:01:02.624 --> 02:01:08.200
robes that hold the symbol of the de Rolo crest.
You see it look at its hands, and you see it look

02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:13.952
at you and look at Percy on the ground,
unconscious, and it moans out in horror as it

02:01:13.952 --> 02:01:15.120
suddenly dissipates.

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:16.808
SAM: I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!

02:01:16.808 --> 02:01:21.909
TALIESIN: Which one of my ancestors did you just
shame to death? Again?

02:01:21.909 --> 02:01:23.520
SAM: The one who possessed you!

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:24.597
TALIESIN: Okay, fair.

02:01:24.597 --> 02:01:28.650
MARISHA: Again! (laughs)

02:01:28.650 --> 02:01:33.032
TALIESIN: You're going to say it, aren't you?

02:01:33.032 --> 02:01:37.168
LIAM: I double back to Keyleth and start trying to
administer some sort of aid.

02:01:37.168 --> 02:01:38.443
MARISHA: Hi, I'm dead.

02:01:38.443 --> 02:01:39.842
LIAM: Medicine check? Is that it?

02:01:39.842 --> 02:01:42.663
MATT: You can make a medicine check to try to
stabilize her, yeah.

02:01:42.663 --> 02:01:43.825
LIAM: 18.

02:01:43.825 --> 02:01:46.981
MATT: 18, yeah. You stabilize the bleeding. She's
no longer making death saving throws. She is still

02:01:46.981 --> 02:01:52.814
unconscious. You all reconvene. Take a breath.

02:01:52.814 --> 02:01:54.001
SAM: Wait, is Keyleth alive?

02:01:54.001 --> 02:01:54.825
MARISHA: Nope.

02:01:54.825 --> 02:01:55.903
SAM: Oh Jesus! Keyleth, I'm sorry.

02:01:55.903 --> 02:01:57.711
MARISHA: I'm stabilized.

02:01:57.711 --> 02:01:59.841
LIAM: She needs help. Scanlan, come here.

02:01:59.841 --> 02:02:01.678
TALIESIN: Let's pull ourselves together.

02:02:01.678 --> 02:02:08.169
SAM: I will sing a song of rest, which will give
us 1d8 for everybody.

02:02:08.169 --> 02:02:11.180
MATT: For hit dice spent, or just for the rest?

02:02:11.180 --> 02:02:15.171
SAM: I don't know. It just says 1d8. It's my song
of rest.

02:02:15.171 --> 02:02:16.440
MATT: Song of rest.

02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:18.226
TRAVIS: I've got a lot of health potions.

02:02:18.226 --> 02:02:20.978
MARISHA: You do?

02:02:20.978 --> 02:02:21.911
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:02:21.911 --> 02:02:22.888
MARISHA: That's good.

02:02:22.888 --> 02:02:24.382
TALIESIN: I've got three.

02:02:24.382 --> 02:02:25.411
TRAVIS: Would you like one?

02:02:25.411 --> 02:02:26.450
TALIESIN: Probably.

02:02:26.450 --> 02:02:27.877
LAURA: What if we take a short rest?

02:02:27.877 --> 02:02:34.136
MATT: At the end of the short rest, everyone gains
an additional 1d8. It's nice. Doesn't hurt.

02:02:34.136 --> 02:02:37.501
MARISHA: I come to consciousness by Scanlan's
singing?

02:02:37.501 --> 02:02:42.363
SAM: (singing) You're down with more HP. Yeah, you
know me!

02:02:42.453 --> 02:02:44.401
TALIESIN: That's nice.

02:02:44.449 --> 02:02:45.535
MARISHA: What?

02:02:45.535 --> 02:02:46.716
TRAVIS: Hit dice?

02:02:46.716 --> 02:02:47.940
LAURA: Yeah, we can roll some hit dice.

02:02:47.940 --> 02:02:49.458
MATT: You guys take a short rest here to roll some
hit dice.

02:02:49.458 --> 02:02:53.428
MARISHA: (groans) Wait, how much did you heal us,
Scanlan?

02:02:53.428 --> 02:02:57.426
SAM: Just one extra d8. Do I roll that, or do
they?

02:02:57.426 --> 02:02:59.177
MATT: Everyone rolls it on their own. It's fine.

02:02:59.177 --> 02:03:09.554
SAM: Holy ba-Jesus, guys.

02:03:09.554 --> 02:03:10.955
LAURA: That was insane.

02:03:10.955 --> 02:03:12.735
SAM: Can we never do that again?

02:03:12.735 --> 02:03:14.883
LAURA: Well, we're about to, I think.

02:03:14.883 --> 02:03:19.528
LIAM: Who feels like making camp?

02:03:19.528 --> 02:03:21.609
SAM: Making camp?

02:03:21.609 --> 02:03:22.589
LIAM: Yes.

02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:26.062
SAM: We're in a tomb with ghosts. We have to
continue on.

02:03:26.062 --> 02:03:27.357
LIAM: I'm exhausted.

02:03:27.357 --> 02:03:31.600
TALIESIN: We'll heal, but I think we need to
continue down.

02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.648
LAURA: We need to keep going.

02:03:33.648 --> 02:03:43.537
MATT: Cassandra looks about the rest of you, still
seeing a group of herself and her brothers. She

02:03:43.537 --> 02:03:48.696
shakes her head for a second. "We can rest a
moment, but I don't think we can stay here much

02:03:48.696 --> 02:03:53.477
"longer. The more time we spend here, the more
chance they have of returning. If they get the

02:03:53.477 --> 02:03:56.436
"jump on us, we're done."

02:03:56.436 --> 02:03:57.816
TRAVIS: Let's go.

02:03:57.816 --> 02:03:59.980
LAURA: We need to press on.

02:03:59.980 --> 02:04:02.137
SAM: Yeah, aye.

02:04:02.137 --> 02:04:03.331
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:04:03.331 --> 02:04:04.407
SAM: Let's continue.

02:04:04.407 --> 02:04:05.260
TRAVIS: Yeah.

02:04:05.260 --> 02:04:06.901
SAM: Into the tunnel. Into the dark.

02:04:06.901 --> 02:04:15.282
MATT: She sheathes her sword and her dagger.
(sighs) "Let's do this." As you all climb into the

02:04:15.282 --> 02:04:20.190
beginning of the excavation tunnel leading to 
the south, slowly making your way towards--

02:04:20.233 --> 02:04:24.807
SAM: Wait! Sorry. Percival, any point in looting?

02:04:24.807 --> 02:04:28.428
TALIESIN: Don't loot my family's crypt!

02:04:28.428 --> 02:04:32.106
SAM: Sorry! Forget I mentioned it. Let's go kick
some ass.

02:04:32.106 --> 02:04:37.821
MATT: Making your way towards the tunnels beneath
the city of Whitestone, towards whatever this

02:04:37.821 --> 02:04:43.976
ziggurat construction project has been, we will
pick this up the week after Thanksgiving.

02:04:43.976 --> 02:04:46.250
LAURA: Oh man! We're taking a whole week off from
this.

02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:49.579
MATT: Yeah. We went a little late tonight to try
and give a little extra since we're not going to

02:04:49.579 --> 02:04:52.933
be here next week, but that's it for the evening.

02:04:52.975 --> 02:04:57.592
MARISHA: We almost got our ass kicked by ghosts!

02:04:57.592 --> 02:04:59.414
SAM: No, by each other.

02:04:59.414 --> 02:05:00.824
LAURA: We really need a cleric.

02:05:00.824 --> 02:05:05.008
MATT: There were some really bad-- everyone rolled
poorly on those saving throws.

02:05:05.008 --> 02:05:07.077
That sucked. Oh, yes!

02:05:07.077 --> 02:05:09.390
LAURA: Oh, man. Right. Giveaways.

02:05:09.390 --> 02:05:13.446
ZAC: We've got to do a giveaway, so I am opening
the floodgates.

02:05:13.446 --> 02:05:16.676
TALIESIN: Welcome, all!

02:05:16.676 --> 02:05:18.437
LAURA: The whole time.

02:05:18.437 --> 02:05:25.875
TALIESIN: This is Twitch. Holy cow.

02:05:25.875 --> 02:05:28.781
MARISHA: I might need to burn a Cure Wounds or
something.

02:05:28.781 --> 02:05:30.781
TALIESIN: I'm not at a hundred, but I'm okay.

02:05:30.781 --> 02:05:35.751
MARISHA: I burned almost all of my hit dice to
bring me back up.

02:05:35.751 --> 02:05:40.813
TALIESIN: Ashley is getting home right now, in
case we need her.

02:05:40.813 --> 02:05:41.777
LAURA: Yeah.

02:05:41.777 --> 02:05:43.691
MATT: We're good.

02:05:43.691 --> 02:05:45.186
TRAVIS: Are we?

02:05:45.186 --> 02:05:48.550
TALIESIN: Can she come in for 30 seconds and heal
us?

02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:51.302
MATT: (laughs) It doesn't work that way.

02:05:51.302 --> 02:05:52.374
TALIESIN: I know.

02:05:52.374 --> 02:05:56.678
MARISHA: Guys, I got a little bit of a connection!
And gone. That's all.

02:05:56.678 --> 02:06:03.549
ZAC: We also got up to $6,000 total so far,
raised.

02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:05.318
LAURA: Oh wow, that's great!

02:06:05.318 --> 02:06:06.454
MATT: Incredible!

02:06:06.454 --> 02:06:10.191
ZAC: So we will continue that throughout the
weekend, all the way up to Monday.

02:06:10.191 --> 02:06:12.675
MATT: Thank you all so much for helping out.

02:06:12.675 --> 02:06:13.737
TALIESIN: Holy cow.

02:06:13.737 --> 02:06:17.388
MATT: You're helping a lot of wonderful people do
a lot of amazing things in places that need it.

02:06:17.388 --> 02:06:23.265
ZAC: So the floodgates are open. We're going to
let that build up for a little bit and then do the

02:06:23.265 --> 02:06:24.357
giveaway.

02:06:24.357 --> 02:06:27.853
MATT: Oh! Chat room explode!

02:06:27.853 --> 02:06:33.320
ZAC: Oh shoot, that's true. The next episode is
Critmas, as well, isn't it?

02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:34.631
LAURA and TALIESIN: No.

02:06:34.631 --> 02:06:36.168
ZAC: Is there not? There's one before it?

02:06:36.168 --> 02:06:37.470
LAURA: No, there's another one before.

02:06:37.470 --> 02:06:38.419
ZAC: Are you sure?

02:06:38.419 --> 02:06:39.314
TALIESIN: No.

02:06:39.314 --> 02:06:48.537
MARISHA: No, we're doing the Christmas Critmas a
little bit earlier, so we're going to do the next

02:06:48.537 --> 02:06:50.481
one before we go on Christmas break, right?

02:06:50.481 --> 02:06:58.205
MATT: No, the 3rd is the next Critmas. Because the
17th, our last show, is also the opening night of

02:06:58.205 --> 02:07:03.052
the new Star Wars movie, we can't go late that
night because everyone's going to be gone.

02:07:03.052 --> 02:07:06.859
LAURA: Oh. So yeah, we can't do Critmas next
week.

02:07:06.859 --> 02:07:09.253
ZAC: Next week's Thanksgiving.

02:07:09.253 --> 02:07:10.911
LAURA: I mean, on the 3rd.

02:07:10.911 --> 02:07:14.488
ZAC: And we've already told everyone the first
week of the month is--

02:07:14.488 --> 02:07:18.523
SAM: So the Christmas Critmas is going to be the
3rd.

02:07:18.523 --> 02:07:19.640
MATT: It's going to be the 3rd.

02:07:19.640 --> 02:07:20.522
LAURA: December 3rd?

02:07:20.522 --> 02:07:21.295
ZAC: Yes.

02:07:21.295 --> 02:07:22.549
TALIESIN: Yeah, that will be the Crit--

02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:26.001
ZAC: Math is hard, guys.

02:07:26.001 --> 02:07:28.384
MATT: Welcome to our late-night meetings.

02:07:28.384 --> 02:07:30.390
(all laugh)

02:07:30.435 --> 02:07:31.966
ZAC: All right, pull in a winner.

02:07:31.966 --> 02:07:33.332
MATT: We've got a winner coming in.

02:07:33.332 --> 02:07:36.626
LAURA: Can't we just do it the second week? It's
going to be a long episode. We'll have to cut it

02:07:36.626 --> 02:07:37.566
super short.

02:07:37.566 --> 02:07:39.561
MARISHA: That's what I was thinking. Can we move
it to the second week?

02:07:39.561 --> 02:07:41.531
TALIESIN: Move it to the 10th.

02:07:41.531 --> 02:07:43.391
MARISHA: Christmas Critmas is going to be the
10th.

02:07:43.391 --> 02:07:46.582
ZAC: Before we officially say that, let me check
the schedule, because we've already told everyone

02:07:46.582 --> 02:07:50.893
the first week, so before we say that officially,
let me check the schedule and make sure that's

02:07:50.893 --> 02:07:51.705
okay.

02:07:51.705 --> 02:07:53.173
LAURA: It's going to be really hard to do it on
the 3rd.

02:07:53.173 --> 02:07:53.974
ZAC: Okay.

02:07:53.974 --> 02:07:56.113
TALIESIN: I'm literally leaving the studio on the
17th for a road trip.

02:07:56.113 --> 02:07:57.744
ZAC: IEShoemaker is the winner.

02:07:57.744 --> 02:07:59.688
MATT: IEShoemaker, congratulations!

02:07:59.688 --> 02:08:04.554
ZAC: We're sending you a message right now. Send
back with your address and we'll send you all

02:08:04.554 --> 02:08:11.444
sorts of great shit. Tune in tomorrow, guys, for
Group Hug. Hector's bringing a couple of comedian

02:08:11.444 --> 02:08:17.441
friends of his, and they are playing all of the
Jessica Jones Alias characters tomorrow, and

02:08:17.441 --> 02:08:22.959
nobody wanted to play Purple Man.

02:08:22.959 --> 02:08:24.166
MATT: Understandably so.

02:08:24.166 --> 02:08:25.887
TALIESIN: Creepiest character in the Marvel
universe.

02:08:25.887 --> 02:08:27.088
ZAC: How do we do this?

02:08:27.088 --> 02:08:28.334
TALIESIN: He is the creepiest creep.

02:08:28.435 --> 02:08:30.900
ZAC: Whoever plays him has to know you're going to
get your ass kicked.

02:08:30.900 --> 02:08:31.975
MATT: That's Tennant, right?

02:08:31.975 --> 02:08:36.838
TALIESIN: That's Tennant. That's also who I
dressed up as at the superhero party. I painted

02:08:36.838 --> 02:08:38.191
myself purple.

02:08:38.191 --> 02:08:40.206
ZAC: You did Purple Man? Why would you do that?!

02:08:40.206 --> 02:08:43.961
TALIESIN: There's an amazing photo of a friend of
ours dressed as Luke Cage, just beating the shit

02:08:43.961 --> 02:08:45.062
out of me. It's amazing.

02:08:45.062 --> 02:08:46.157
ZAC: Well, that's good.

02:08:46.157 --> 02:08:47.847
MARISHA: He also sang Gogol Bordello's--

02:08:47.847 --> 02:08:49.210
MARISHA and TALIESIN: "Start Wearing Purple."

02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:50.877
MATT: It was good.

02:08:50.877 --> 02:08:52.587
TALIESIN: It was creepy.

02:08:52.587 --> 02:08:56.906
MATT: I'm just excited to see all the Doctor Who
Tennant fans watch the series for Tennant and then

02:08:56.906 --> 02:08:59.905
be like, "Oh no, no, no!"

02:08:59.905 --> 02:09:04.516
ZAC: Yeah. Sorry, guys. No bueno.

02:09:04.516 --> 02:09:06.727
TALIESIN: It's just going to be bad.

02:09:06.727 --> 02:09:09.169
ZAC: Sweet. That's it for tonight, guys.

02:09:09.169 --> 02:09:10.358
MATT: Thank you guys so much.

02:09:10.358 --> 02:09:12.179
MARISHA: See you in two weeks!

02:09:12.179 --> 02:09:14.000
MATT: For the next episode. See you guys in two weeks.

02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:15.138
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!

02:09:15.138 --> 02:09:21.414
MARISHA: There will still be a new comic next week
to hold you guys over. And playlists. Guess whose

02:09:21.457 --> 02:09:22.933
playlist is next.

02:09:22.933 --> 02:09:24.885
TRAVIS: Oh, is it mine?

02:09:24.885 --> 02:09:26.187
MARISHA: You're the last one, right?

02:09:26.187 --> 02:09:27.457
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm the Thanksgiving playlist.

02:09:27.457 --> 02:09:28.962
SAM: Does the DM get a playlist?

02:09:28.962 --> 02:09:29.895
MATT: I get one.

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.807
MARISHA: He does, but he'll go last. Because you
always go last.

02:09:31.807 --> 02:09:34.385
MATT: All right, guys. Thank you so much. Have a
wonderful evening.

02:09:34.385 --> 02:09:35.463
We'll see you in a couple of weeks.

02:09:35.463 --> 02:09:36.241
MARISHA: Bye!

02:09:36.241 --> 02:09:37.129
SAM: Happy Thanksgiving.

02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:39.123
TALIESIN: Happy Thanksgiving!
